flat fish#8597,all base b numbers
pitiful fish#4619,is the kandell living room lamp broken again
flat fish#8597,up to 100_b
flat fish#8597,so
flat fish#8597,how many b
flat fish#8597,is the sum of the squares of the digits of N (when N is represented in base b) less than or equal to 256
pitiful fish#4619,oh
pitiful fish#4619,yes
flat fish#8597,geflep
flat fish#8597,so using gaussian sums
flat fish#8597,we get
flat fish#8597,(101_b * 100_b)/2
flat fish#8597,WAH

flat fish#8597,aHAHAHAAHA
flat fish#8597,do you know what 言い is?
pitiful fish#4619,?
pitiful fish#4619,idk
flat fish#8597,ohh i remember nvm
flat fish#8597,it means like
flat fish#8597,please when stringed with something else
flat fish#8597,something like that
pitiful fish#4619,verb always goes at the end of a sentence
pitiful fish#4619,and its connected to other things by phrases
pitiful fish#4619,"so if i wanted to say ""I go to school at 9 AM"""
pitiful fish#4619,its like
pitiful fish#4619,"""At 9 AM (time connecter) go to school"""
pitiful fish#4619,actually its more like
flat fish#8597,9 am is to school go?
pitiful fish#4619,"""At 9 AM (time connecter) to school (verb connecter) go"""
flat fish#8597,reverse english
pitiful fish#4619,time/location connector (called a particle) is ni
pitiful fish#4619,and verb connecter in this case is e
flat fish#8597,in
flat fish#8597,this case?
flat fish#8597,how many are there
pitiful fish#4619,idk
pitiful fish#4619,a few
pitiful fish#4619,"cuz theres like ""watashi wa ..."""
pitiful fish#4619,where wa is the particle
flat fish#8597,wa
flat fish#8597,ye
pitiful fish#4619,but you dont use wa for when its not the topic of the sentence
pitiful fish#4619,"so ""going to school"" uses e"
pitiful fish#4619,"while ""I am"" uses wa"
flat fish#8597,is wa like
pitiful fish#4619,youll see
flat fish#8597,wa or ha
pitiful fish#4619,baba
flat fish#8597,oh

pitiful fish#4619,bingkai1215
pitiful fish#4619,if we want to seriously learn japanese we cant rely on duolingo
pitiful fish#4619,according to my sister
pitiful fish#4619,because we arent learning the sentence formations
pitiful fish#4619,nor are we memorizing all of the basic hiragana and katakana
pitiful fish#4619,once we learn those basics we can use duolingo
flat fish#8597,oh no
flat fish#8597,does your sister japanese
pitiful fish#4619,yes
flat fish#8597,not your babi boi (ava464646) keeps taking my number one spot on the leaderboard

pitiful fish#4619,the 75 min one came before the 4 hr one
flat fish#8597,why did they make a second 4 hour one?
flat fish#8597,did the first not really cover all basics?
flat fish#8597,was there a 4 times increase in the amount of basics in japanese in three months?
flat fish#8597,it's a strange one

flat fish#8597,what is the da

pitiful fish#4619,used in casual speech
flat fish#8597,uh
flat fish#8597,o
flat fish#8597,uh
pitiful fish#4619,so its like desu but casual
pitiful fish#4619,so id use da with u
flat fish#8597,with me?
flat fish#8597,me!
flat fish#8597,with me!
flat fish#8597,so (i) am china's person
pitiful fish#4619,china person
pitiful fish#4619,thats the whole sentence
pitiful fish#4619,the meaning depends on context
pitiful fish#4619,"most logically, it means ""I am china person"
pitiful fish#4619,""""
flat fish#8597,china's?
flat fish#8597,'s
flat fish#8597,because no

pitiful fish#4619,https://play.chess.com/U6ds
flat fish#8597,wait why
pitiful fish#4619,after trade u threaten rook?
flat fish#8597,i saw you at the middle school
pitiful fish#4619,i didnt see u at the middle shcool
flat fish#8597,i noticed that you didn't see me at the middle school at the middle school
flat fish#8597,wait i didn't know there were two william wangs
flat fish#8597,k nobody else i know do i know knows how to program
flat fish#8597,except troy
flat fish#8597,ok i meant nobody else i can contact easily
flat fish#8597,so i'll just tell you
flat fish#8597,in python
flat fish#8597,you can pass functions into functions
flat fish#8597,wa
pitiful fish#4619,iwas
pitiful fish#4619,drgfjkrxd
pitiful fish#4619,send me code
flat fish#8597,i dont' have
flat fish#8597,but in python you can do that somehow
flat fish#8597,ai you
flat fish#8597,what the heck
flat fish#8597,ok so there's this thing called a decorator
flat fish#8597,where you change a function
flat fish#8597,because that's a thing somehow
flat fish#8597,for example
flat fish#8597,"`def inc(x):`
`    print(x + 1)`
`    return x + 1`
`def dec(x):`
`    print(x + 1)`
`    return x - 1`
` `
`def my_decorator(func):`
`    def decorate():`
`        print(""DECORATION"")`
`        func()`
`        print(""more decoration"")`
`    return decorate`"
pitiful fish#4619,ok
flat fish#8597,so
flat fish#8597,let's say x = 9
flat fish#8597,so if you do `x = inc(x)`
flat fish#8597,the output is `10` and x now has the value of 10
flat fish#8597,ok so let's say now we run `inc = my_decorator(inc)`
flat fish#8597,"so now inc is equivalent to the following code:
`print(""DECORATION"")`
`print(x + 1)`
`return x + 1`
`print(""more decoration"")`"
pitiful fish#4619,syntax?
pitiful fish#4619,ok
pitiful fish#4619,i get it
flat fish#8597,sorry i died the thing
pitiful fish#4619,so u basically just change the function mid-function
flat fish#8597,ok wait i don't think that works in this situation because the func has a return statement
flat fish#8597,so you would never print `more decoration`
flat fish#8597,because it would return right before
flat fish#8597,but that's so strange
flat fish#8597,maybe c++ is the strange one
flat fish#8597,but python is quite the large
pitiful fish#4619,yeah yeah
pitiful fish#4619,ok
pitiful fish#4619,so whats the issue
flat fish#8597,"the issue is in python you can return functions, pass functions as parameters, and define functions in functions"
flat fish#8597,that's not fair \:(
flat fish#8597,we don't do that in c++
pitiful fish#4619,never learned c++ 🙂
flat fish#8597,c++ is more strict but once you learned the rules you can do anything you want
flat fish#8597,because of macros
pitiful fish#4619,python maks sense though
flat fish#8597,ye it's almost english
flat fish#8597,but in c++ you can do things like `#define true (rand()%100 < 98)`
pitiful fish#4619,?
flat fish#8597,so
pitiful fish#4619,look
pitiful fish#4619,i can type c++ too
pitiful fish#4619,*(%&*$ nfjfndsf R$
flat fish#8597,lines beginning with # are known as preprocessor statements
flat fish#8597,they are executed before compile time
flat fish#8597,so what `#define a b` does is it finds every instance where `a` is written in the code and replaces it with `b`
pitiful fish#4619,thats literally a parser
pitiful fish#4619,wtf
pitiful fish#4619,why do u have one thats built in
pitiful fish#4619,yo
flat fish#8597,so `#define true (rand()%100 < 98)`
flat fish#8597,"replaces every ""true"" in the code"
flat fish#8597,with (rand()%100 < 98)
flat fish#8597,do you understand now
pitiful fish#4619,ok
flat fish#8597,do you get how evil that is
pitiful fish#4619,yeah thats op
flat fish#8597,yeah using preprocessor statements you can basically create your own programming language
flat fish#8597,ysing c++
flat fish#8597,like
flat fish#8597,`#define AutoString(s) string s = #s`
flat fish#8597,"`AutoString(MyString)` is now the same as `string MyString = ""MyString""`"
flat fish#8597,maybe c++ is the one that is not fair
flat fish#8597,Apparently jamais actually means forever
flat fish#8597,So ne verb jamais is actually not verb in forever
pitiful fish#4619,"when used as an adverb, the i at the end of i-adjectives becomes a ku
when used as an adverb, the na and the end of na-adjectives becomes a ni"
pitiful fish#4619,yay

flat fish#8597,is
flat fish#8597,what
flat fish#8597,i mean
flat fish#8597,よろしく
pitiful fish#4619,よろしくおねがいします is just a greeting
pitiful fish#4619,because
flat fish#8597,it's
flat fish#8597,nice to meet you
flat fish#8597,but what the big
pitiful fish#4619,"你好 doesnt literally mean ""you're good"""
pitiful fish#4619,see?
flat fish#8597,i mean

pitiful fish#4619,its typically viewed as a greeting

pitiful fish#4619,"because ""nice to meet you"" is also ""はじめまして”"
flat fish#8597,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
flat fish#8597,that's pretty good
flat fish#8597,but hard and ugly
pitiful fish#4619,"and that literally means ""first time (meeting in a formal way)"""
pitiful fish#4619,"so whats even more complicated is that the verb ""to meet"" is ”会う”"
pitiful fish#4619,あう

flat fish#8597,and you reply what about dogs and cats?
flat fish#8597,there are dgos and cats
pitiful fish#4619,???
pitiful fish#4619,what that ? !! !1?!?1///
flat fish#8597,like
flat fish#8597,if we were on a call
flat fish#8597,and i cut out
flat fish#8597,"and you only heard ""dogs and cats"""
flat fish#8597,"then you ask ""what about dogs and cats?"""
flat fish#8597,"i reply ""there are dogs and cats"""
flat fish#8597,in that situation i use WA (ha) and not ga right
pitiful fish#4619,uh
pitiful fish#4619,no?
pitiful fish#4619,why
pitiful fish#4619,"犬と猫はいます is ""in general, dogs and cats exist"""
pitiful fish#4619,look
pitiful fish#4619,here's an easier way to think about ti
pitiful fish#4619,it
pitiful fish#4619,"""wa"" marks the subject of the sentence"
pitiful fish#4619,"while ""ga"" marks the topic"
pitiful fish#4619,"in the sentence ""dogs and cats exist"""
pitiful fish#4619,"""dogs and cats"" is the subject"
pitiful fish#4619,"while in ""there are dogs and cats"""
pitiful fish#4619,"""there"" is the subject"
pitiful fish#4619,"as the subject in this case is implied, wa is not used"
flat fish#8597,btu  owjhat
flat fish#8597,you ayss
flat fish#8597,oo/1
flat fish#8597,/giphy ?
flat fish#8597,kjfkalsm?
flat fish#8597,"ok but isn't ga like for the answer to ""there are what?"""
flat fish#8597,"""there are dogs and cats"""
pitiful fish#4619,no
pitiful fish#4619,so
pitiful fish#4619,uh
flat fish#8597,;;;; ; ;; ;; ;;  ;;;;;;;
pitiful fish#4619,ok
pitiful fish#4619,"say i ask ""who here is the student?"""
pitiful fish#4619,"u answer ""watashi ga gakusei desu"""
pitiful fish#4619,say we're having a conversation
pitiful fish#4619,"and i say ""that bird is white"""
flat fish#8597,yo what the frick man
pitiful fish#4619,"""that bird is white"" translates to あの鳥が(white)です"
pitiful fish#4619,idk the word for white
pitiful fish#4619,"""ga"" can also be used for emphasis"
pitiful fish#4619,but this is kinda weird
pitiful fish#4619,several words must come after ga
pitiful fish#4619,like
pitiful fish#4619,suki
pitiful fish#4619,or wakaru
pitiful fish#4619,(wakarimasu)
pitiful fish#4619,in this case
pitiful fish#4619,ga is used because the speaker wants to specify that only some dogs and cats in a certain area exist
pitiful fish#4619,wa implies that cats and dogs exist in all places
pitiful fish#4619,"grammatically correct, but doesn't always hold true"
flat fish#8597,k i'm praticaistng the icoavlsmn right now we can do a talking later1

flat fish#8597,wait
flat fish#8597,it's free?
flat fish#8597,oh
flat fish#8597,the
flat fish#8597,certit=ficate
flat fish#8597,oh
flat fish#8597,dude you should have told me that
flat fish#8597,i thought
flat fish#8597,you got some japanese course
flat fish#8597,on a random website
flat fish#8597,that you paid 50dollars for
flat fish#8597,not on coursera
flat fish#8597,wherasdkl
flat fish#8597,ai ya
flat fish#8597,dude i'm in this coursera course
flat fish#8597,intro to classical music
flat fish#8597,i've reset deadlines 3 times haha

flat fish#8597,the sunk costs fallacy doens't allow it
flat fish#8597,folky man i've spent at least 1.5k experience worth of time on duolingo doing japanese
pitiful fish#4619,nono
pitiful fish#4619,thats fine
pitiful fish#4619,because honestly
pitiful fish#4619,this course bombards you with vocabulary
pitiful fish#4619,so its impossible to learn all of it in one week
flat fish#8597,ok i have more than one week i think
pitiful fish#4619,if u have the duolingo background vocab youll go through it very quickly
pitiful fish#4619,plus
pitiful fish#4619,duolingo teaches barely any grammar
pitiful fish#4619,this one will cover all the bases
pitiful fish#4619,so a combination of duolingo with this course is the best way to learn japanese
flat fish#8597,bombards with vocab haha
flat fish#8597,probably why french was so slow
flat fish#8597,did not
flat fish#8597,do
flat fish#8597,also did you ever find the actual answer to william's pepsi problem

flat fish#8597,idk how much you care but there's some godo stuff in there
flat fish#8597,if you don't want to spend 12 min of your time watching that basically WEQ is the most important combo because your e slows so you can hit two Qs
flat fish#8597,if you hit both Qs and E that's three attacks with abilities so it procs electrocute for more burst (electrocute has a longer cooldown than your abilities though)
flat fish#8597,WQE is faster but really hard to hit
flat fish#8597,R E AA Q AA R is your ult combo and the auto attacks aren't really necessary but it's so much extra damage if you can fit them in between abilities

pitiful fish#4619,so
flat fish#8597,anywayS
pitiful fish#4619,the thing i sent u at the top is for COLLOQUIAL speech
pitiful fish#4619,so like
pitiful fish#4619,me and u
flat fish#8597,m hm
pitiful fish#4619,the thing they mention here and in the lesson is FORMAL speech
pitiful fish#4619,so like
pitiful fish#4619,with your teacher
pitiful fish#4619,or something
pitiful fish#4619,and the te-form is the same conjugation as COLLOQUIAL except the ta's and da's are replaced by te's and de's
pitiful fish#4619,masu-form (FORMAL) is easy
flat fish#8597,what
flat fish#8597,what
flat fish#8597,what
flat fish#8597,what
pitiful fish#4619,u havent learned te-form yet right
flat fish#8597,what
pitiful fish#4619,ok then just dont worry about te-form
flat fish#8597,
pitiful fish#4619,for now just know that there are 5 different kinds of every u-verb
flat fish#8597,yeah and they correspond with a i e o u right
pitiful fish#4619,ru-verbs are more simple

pitiful fish#4619,ok and to tell the difference between u and ru verbs
flat fish#8597,wiat what
flat fish#8597,they all have names
flat fish#8597,why
flat fish#8597,who
flat fish#8597,negative stem
flat fish#8597,masu stem
flat fish#8597,dictionary stem
pitiful fish#4619,"so the consonant sound before the ""ru"" in a ru verb is either an ""e"" or ""i"" sound"
flat fish#8597,iimperative stem
pitiful fish#4619,yeah
pitiful fish#4619,so
flat fish#8597,VOLITIONAL stem
pitiful fish#4619,yeah
pitiful fish#4619,dont worry about that

pitiful fish#4619,no
pitiful fish#4619,those are the weird ones
flat fish#8597,the stem is just the constanant with the corresponding vowel
flat fish#8597,what
flat fish#8597,wait what
pitiful fish#4619,uh
pitiful fish#4619,the past tense conjugation for group 1 verbs in COLLOQUIAL speech is very odd
flat fish#8597,ok so what we're learning is formal
flat fish#8597,poilte
pitiful fish#4619,yeah
flat fish#8597,are they going to teach coloqk
pitiful fish#4619,but soon u learn te-form
pitiful fish#4619,te-form is formal but uses colloquial

pitiful fish#4619,"theres also like the ""honorific"""
pitiful fish#4619,eee
flat fish#8597,oh no

flat fish#8597,ok what
pitiful fish#4619,"何ですか？could either mean ""why?"" or ""by what?"""
pitiful fish#4619,context dependednt
pitiful fish#4619,dependent
pitiful fish#4619,"and when it means ""why"" its nan"
pitiful fish#4619,"when its ""by what"" its nani"
pitiful fish#4619,but thats like
pitiful fish#4619,very rare
pitiful fish#4619,so
flat fish#8597,japanese verb wa gay desu ne
flat fish#8597,**sou desu**
flat fish#8597,k wtf the verb document makes no sense
flat fish#8597,ok why are there five forms for each verb then?
flat fish#8597,five stems
flat fish#8597,wait what
flat fish#8597,am i being uglly
flat fish#8597,i'm so conau
pitiful fish#4619,yhea there are
flat fish#8597,ok ok ok so
flat fish#8597,
flat fish#8597,ok so what
flat fish#8597,so each verb thing has one root and the stem is something you get usually from removing the ru or somthing like that right?
flat fish#8597,"then there are five forms you can make, each corresponding with a vowel"
flat fish#8597,what are those forms
pitiful fish#4619,uh
pitiful fish#4619,for u-verbs the stem is formed by replacing the last sound with its i-equivalent
flat fish#8597,ye
flat fish#8597,so shinu
flat fish#8597,shina
flat fish#8597,shini
flat fish#8597,shinu

pitiful fish#4619,"t some stage in the origin of life, an informational polymer must have arisen by purely chemical means. According to one version of the ‘RNA world’ hypothesis1–3 this polymer was RNA, but attempts to provide experimental support for this have failed4,5. In particular, although there has been some success demonstrating that ‘activated’ ribonucleotides can polymerize to form RNA6,7, it is far from obvious how such ribonucleotides could have formed from their constituent parts (ribose and nucleobases). Ribose is difficult to form selectively8,9, and the addition of nucleobases to ribose is inefficient in the case of purines10 and does not occur at all in the case of the canonical pyrimidines11. Here we show that activated pyrimidine ribonucleotides can be formed in a short sequence that bypasses free ribose and the nucleobases, and instead proceeds through arabinose amino-oxazoline and anhydronucleoside intermediates. The starting materials for the synthesis—cyanamide, cyanoacetylene, glycolaldehyde, glyceraldehyde and inorganic phosphate—are plausible prebiotic feedstock molecules12–15, and the conditions of the synthesis are consistent with potential early-Earth geochemical models. Although inorganic phosphate is only incorporated into the nucleotides at a late stage of the sequence, its presence from the start is essential as it controls three reactions in the earlier stages by acting as a general acid/base catalyst, a nucleophilic catalyst, a pH buffer and a chemical buffer. For prebiotic reaction sequences, our results highlight the importance of working with mixed chemical systems in which reactants for a particular reaction step can also control other steps."

In particular, although there has been some success demonstrating that ‘activated’ ribonucleotides can polymerize to form RNA6,7, it is far from obvious how such ribonucleotides could have formed from their constituent parts (ribose and nucleobases). Ribose is difficult to form selectively8,9, and the addition of nucleobases to ribose is inefficient in the case of purines10 and does not occur at all in the case of the canonical pyrimidines11. Here we show that activated pyrimidine ribonucleotides can be formed in a short sequence that bypasses free ribose and the nucleobases, and instead proceeds through arabinose amino-oxazoline and anhydronucleoside intermediates. The starting materials for the synthesis—cyanamide, cyanoacetylene, glycolaldehyde, glyceraldehyde and inorganic phosphate—are plausible prebiotic feedstock molecules12–15, and the conditions of the synthesis are consistent with potential early-Earth geochemical models. Although inorganic phosphate is only incorporated into the nucleotides at a late stage of the sequence, its presence from the start is essential as it controls three reactions in the earlier stages by acting as a general acid/base catalyst, a nucleophilic catalyst, a pH buffer and a chemical buffer. For prebiotic reaction sequences, our results highlight the importance of working with mixed chemical systems in which reactants for a particular reaction step can also control other steps."

flat fish#8597,and two brothers fell into the well
flat fish#8597,now varus is three people
flat fish#8597,but actually one person
flat fish#8597,it's not

flat fish#8597,poop
flat fish#8597,i need two matching usernames
flat fish#8597,for bridge accounts
pitiful fish#4619,no
flat fish#8597,k
flat fish#8597,have you seen
flat fish#8597,15 sorting algorithms in 6 minutes
flat fish#8597,it's so nerdy if you like it but it's actually entertaining
flat fish#8597,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg
flat fish#8597,if you watch whole thing you will be rewarded
flat fish#8597,trust
pitiful fish#4619,why dont i just skip to end
pitiful fish#4619,also can u play league with us
flat fish#8597,maybe

flat fish#8597,or something
flat fish#8597,ndmscmc'
flat fish#8597,btw what is your most hated game
flat fish#8597,because i answerd valorant but is that your most hated?
pitiful fish#4619,yes
flat fish#8597,oh
flat fish#8597,dude i was expecting a math quesiton or something not
flat fish#8597,difference nani and nan
pitiful fish#4619,idfk
flat fish#8597,
pitiful fish#4619,yeah
pitiful fish#4619,those are shit
flat fish#8597,
flat fish#8597,A?AA?A?A
flat fish#8597,what the hell
flat fish#8597,so i realized i should probably study the vocabulary lists
flat fish#8597,uh
pitiful fish#4619,yeah
pitiful fish#4619,so what i do
pitiful fish#4619,i open new tab
pitiful fish#4619,and look at list while doing the test
flat fish#8597,same
flat fish#8597,by new tab you mean the vocab  list in new tab?
pitiful fish#4619,yeah
flat fish#8597,so you don't study it either?
flat fish#8597,yay!
pitiful fish#4619,i study it a little
flat fish#8597,shinu
flat fish#8597,85% percent sounds bad but using self-justification i say that's 17/20 and fuck the other three
flat fish#8597,is there a casual speech desu
pitiful fish#4619,kinda
pitiful fish#4619,theres da
pitiful fish#4619,which makes a sentence delcarative
pitiful fish#4619,but its not the same meaning
flat fish#8597,if you have an i adj
flat fish#8597,like
flat fish#8597,yasui
flat fish#8597,cheap
flat fish#8597,so was cheap is yasukatta
flat fish#8597,if you put desu for politely cheap
flat fish#8597,do you put desu or deshita
flat fish#8597,oh wait ok they say desu nvm
flat fish#8597,ok so i think i understand verbs better
flat fish#8597,group 2 verbs like oki
flat fish#8597,the two things you can add are masu and
flat fish#8597,ok no
flat fish#8597,there is dictionary form
flat fish#8597,and masu form
flat fish#8597,when do you use dictionary form?
flat fish#8597,in normal speech
pitiful fish#4619,yes
pitiful fish#4619,deshita is past tense also
pitiful fish#4619,ok
pitiful fish#4619,so
pitiful fish#4619,yasui desu
pitiful fish#4619,kore wa yasui desu
pitiful fish#4619,kore wa yasui deshita
pitiful fish#4619,wait
pitiful fish#4619,gimme one sev
pitiful fish#4619,playing ow
flat fish#8597,yeyeeye i think i get
pitiful fish#4619,ok so if yasui is used in the predicative form u never need the katta
pitiful fish#4619,all u need is deshita
pitiful fish#4619,or mashita depending on sentence
pitiful fish#4619,If it’s in modifier pos u conjugate it
pitiful fish#4619,And u end with desu or masu
flat fish#8597,why do the numbers hvae 4 different forms
flat fish#8597,in duolingo they al had two
flat fish#8597,ok
flat fish#8597,this course is kind of poopoo
pitiful fish#4619,wdym numbers
flat fish#8597,week three
pitiful fish#4619,4 diff forms?
flat fish#8597,no
flat fish#8597,only 10 does that i thnk
pitiful fish#4619,its onyomi and kunyomi
pitiful fish#4619,so
pitiful fish#4619,for example
pitiful fish#4619,the number 4
pitiful fish#4619,in some cases shi is used
pitiful fish#4619,"in others, yon is used"
pitiful fish#4619,or just yo
pitiful fish#4619,depends on whether its kanji dependent or not
pitiful fish#4619,i think
flat fish#8597,yeah i now i thnk duolingo explained it a bit
flat fish#8597,but ten has 4 versions idk
pitiful fish#4619,yeah so
pitiful fish#4619,tenth month
pitiful fish#4619,tenth day
pitiful fish#4619,diff tens
pitiful fish#4619,but
pitiful fish#4619,if u look at 20th day of the month
pitiful fish#4619,it makes absolutely no sense
pitiful fish#4619,so
pitiful fish#4619,the vocab list highlights the days that are weird
pitiful fish#4619,u can see
flat fish#8597,*
flat fish#8597,i just watched amadeus
pitiful fish#4619,aight movei
flat fish#8597,btw want to go to richard's house tomorrow

flat fish#8597,\:P
flat fish#8597,pee
flat fish#8597,want to play league?
pitiful fish#4619,um
pitiful fish#4619,maybe
pitiful fish#4619,if other pepoel
flat fish#8597,i asked stephane and ian
flat fish#8597,they haven't responded yet
flat fish#8597,i'll let you know
pitiful fish#4619,ok
pitiful fish#4619,did they respond?
flat fish#8597,ian said no
flat fish#8597,stephane didn't
flat fish#8597,brb i'm giong to other computer to write a useful program
flat fish#8597,what the hell
flat fish#8597,this was randomly generated
flat fish#8597,no
flat fish#8597,i put in spong
flat fish#8597,and the random symbols
flat fish#8597,they somehow were all that apostrophe thing
flat fish#8597,idk
flat fish#8597,what
flat fish#8597,?
flat fish#8597,what command?
flat fish#8597,for what
flat fish#8597,oh
flat fish#8597,i spent whole morning
flat fish#8597,on this
flat fish#8597,LOL
flat fish#8597,watch stream
flat fish#8597,give word
flat fish#8597,and length
pitiful fish#4619,"A further problem is the susceptibility of RNA to base-catalyzed hydrolysis at pH >6 [35]. The phosphodiester bonds of the RNA backbone and the ester bond between tRNAs and amino acids – something similar to which would have been critical for the evolution of ribosomal protein synthesis – are both more stable at pH 4–5 [5,6]. With our proposal for RNA world evolution at acidic pH [5], we have suggested that the primordial ‘soup’ may have been more like vinaigrette, while Hanczyc [36] has drawn a comparison with mayonnaise, with its emulsified mixture of oil in water (in light of these, could there be potential for food science to provide insights for origin of life studies?) While Mg2+ is important for stabilizing RNA secondary and tertiary structure, high Mg2+ concentrations also catalyze RNA degradation, which has been identified as a particular problem in the case of RNA template copying [21]. Here too, acidic pH offers a possible solution, as the positive charge on protonated cytosine and adenosine residues in acidic conditions may reduce the requirement for divalent cations. For example, a self-cleaving ribozyme with maximum activity at pH 4 isolated by in vitro selection, is active in the absence of divalent ions (including Mg2+) [37]. RNA secondary (and tertiary) structure would appear to be compatible with the presence of protonated nucleotides, as we have found an increased number of potentially protonated A-C base pair ‘mismatches’ in the tRNAs from acidophilic archaeal species with reported cytoplasmic pHs of 4.6-6.2 [5]."
flat fish#8597,ok
flat fish#8597,what is length
flat fish#8597,of new string
flat fish#8597,nonon
flat fish#8597,like
flat fish#8597,how long do you want
flat fish#8597,the new string to be
flat fish#8597,so how many decorating chars
flat fish#8597,no probably not
flat fish#8597,might take a while
flat fish#8597,here actualy
flat fish#8597,uh
flat fish#8597,ok i'm running again
flat fish#8597,what the hell
flat fish#8597,ohh
flat fish#8597,i think
flat fish#8597,you're paragraph is already more than 1500 char
flat fish#8597,yeah
flat fish#8597,
flat fish#8597,it's 15000
flat fish#8597,uh
flat fish#8597,check in your google docs
flat fish#8597,how many characters
flat fish#8597,the paragraph is
flat fish#8597,so we can enter better number than 15000
flat fish#8597,k idk why the middle has so many ͽ characters
flat fish#8597,makes me doubt the random func
flat fish#8597,no
flat fish#8597,well
flat fish#8597,maybe
flat fish#8597,if we remove all characters above 128
flat fish#8597,ok i do that now
flat fish#8597,or not now
flat fish#8597,i'm going to go eat
flat fish#8597,beeb ey1u
flat fish#8597,hynyeah?
flat fish#8597,want to bike to richard's house

flat fish#8597,poopoo!
flat fish#8597,poopoo!
flat fish#8597,HOW WAS YOUR POOPOO

pitiful fish#4619,"RNA replication must proceed with a minimum fidelity, as defined by the “error threshold” (24, 25), to avoid corruption of encoded genetic information. tC19Z contains the C60U mutation in the catalytic core, as well as several other mutations that could potentially affect its fidelity. We determined aggregate fidelities (both deletion mutations and nucleotide misincorporations) of the different ribozymes by sequencing full-length extension products (Fig. 5). This method measures the fidelity of the ribozyme for the synthesis of a given sequence (7, 18), however, truncated extension products are not probed for potential errors (see supporting online material text S1). By this measure, we determined tC19Z’s fidelity as 8.8 × 10−3 (fig. S8), which suggested an improvement compared with both the parent R18 (4.3 × 10−2) (18) and the intermediate tC19 (2.7 × 10−2) ribozymes. Some RNA sequences are synthesized by tC19Z with even greater accuracy. Analysis of the hammerhead ribozymes synthesized by tC19Z revealed just two mutations in 37 sequenced clones (2× G→A transitions in 999 nt), which indicates a fidelity of 2 × 10−3—a 20-fold improvement over the fidelity of the parent R18 ribozyme. Although comparisons are imperfect because of some differences between the sequences sampled for the different ribozymes, there is a notable reduction in A→G transition mutations in the mutation spectrum of tC19Z (and to a lesser extent in tC19), which suggests a reduced susceptibility to misincorporation of G opposite template U. On the other hand, the reverse C→U transition mutation (denoting misincorporation of U opposite template G) is not decreased, indicating an asymmetric, i.e., strand-specific recognition of the G•U wobble pair by tC19Z."

pitiful fish#4619,how do c and d???????????????
pitiful fish#4619,also for d) its y = f(x/2)
pitiful fish#4619,i feel liek dumbo
flat fish#8597,tf happened to the formatting
pitiful fish#4619,idk
pitiful fish#4619,but
pitiful fish#4619,how do?
flat fish#8597,uh
flat fish#8597,c and d
flat fish#8597,so y = f(2x) and y = f(x/2)
pitiful fish#4619,ye
flat fish#8597,well
flat fish#8597,"y = f(x) => (3, 4)"
flat fish#8597,so now we have f(2x)
flat fish#8597,so 2x = 3
flat fish#8597,right
pitiful fish#4619,uh
pitiful fish#4619,no?
pitiful fish#4619,yes?
flat fish#8597,i think
pitiful fish#4619,"for a is 3,8 right"
pitiful fish#4619,for b its 3 6
pitiful fish#4619,"3,6"
flat fish#8597,uh
flat fish#8597,yes
pitiful fish#4619,but for c
pitiful fish#4619,when u plug in 3
pitiful fish#4619,u get f(6)
pitiful fish#4619,which we dont know right
pitiful fish#4619,so do we have to make it so that 2x=3?
flat fish#8597,uh

pitiful fish#4619,"A further problem is the susceptibility of RNA to base-catalyzed hydrolysis at pH >6 [35]. The phosphodiester bonds of the RNA backbone and the ester bond between tRNAs and amino acids – something similar to which would have been critical for the evolution of ribosomal protein synthesis – are both more stable at pH 4–5 [5, 6]. With our proposal for RNA world evolution at acidic pH [5], we have suggested that the primordial ‘soup’ may have been more like vinaigrette, while Hanczyc [36] has drawn a comparison with mayonnaise, with its emulsified mixture of oil in water (in light of these, could there be potential for food science to provide insights for origin of life studies?) While Mg2+ is important for stabilizing RNA secondary and tertiary structure, high Mg2+ concentrations also catalyze RNA degradation, which has been identified as a particular problem in the case of RNA template copying [21]. Here too, acidic pH offers a possible solution, as the positive charge on protonated cytosine and adenosine residues in acidic conditions may reduce the requirement for divalent cations. For example, a self-cleaving ribozyme with maximum activity at pH 4 isolated by in vitro selection, is active in the absence of divalent ions (including Mg2+) [37]. RNA secondary (and tertiary) structure would appear to be compatible with the presence of protonated nucleotides, as we have found an increased number of potentially protonated A-C base pair ‘mismatches’ in the tRNAs from acidophilic archaeal species with reported cytoplasmic pHs of 4.6-6.2 [5]."

flat fish#8597,
flat fish#8597,
flat fish#8597,
flat fish#8597,
flat fish#8597,i can't decide
flat fish#8597,
flat fish#8597,why is he
flat fish#8597,camera
pitiful fish#4619,yeah
flat fish#8597,??
flat fish#8597,what's arda's last name
pitiful fish#4619,fasci
flat fish#8597,fasci
flat fish#8597,oh did he not go to jls
flat fish#8597,what
flat fish#8597,no but
flat fish#8597,fasci
flat fish#8597,is his last name
flat fish#8597,right
flat fish#8597,it's not in the yearbook
flat fish#8597,k
flat fish#8597,what boaut the british guy
flat fish#8597,lo
flat fish#8597,idk his name
flat fish#8597,what
flat fish#8597,well
flat fish#8597,top
flat fish#8597,stream?
flat fish#8597,are you paying
flat fish#8597,ooo nice
flat fish#8597,yeah you're playing with level 100 then with level 20s
flat fish#8597,you won lane against talon?
flat fish#8597,that means you're better than the talon! it's skill based matchup
flat fish#8597,yeah
flat fish#8597,whoever gets a kill snowballs so much
flat fish#8597,because it's assassin vs assassin
flat fish#8597,and they do that
flat fish#8597,for poke?
flat fish#8597,what
flat fish#8597,yeah
flat fish#8597,no it is
flat fish#8597,if you want to poke you can play orianna though
flat fish#8597,4?
flat fish#8597,uh
flat fish#8597,wait what
flat fish#8597,idk how you did that
flat fish#8597,yeah so melee vs range is just you wait until 6 and then one shot them so it's kind of boring but before 6 it's stay healthy and poke
flat fish#8597,most important is stay healthy
flat fish#8597,melee vs melee is harder but it's more fun
flat fish#8597,yeah
flat fish#8597,ok
flat fish#8597,faker
flat fish#8597,is
flat fish#8597,good everything player
flat fish#8597,he can play anybody
flat fish#8597,well
flat fish#8597,your q does less damage
flat fish#8597,oh ok lol was just about to tell you that
flat fish#8597,but it's not like they can keep tanking your reduced damage q
flat fish#8597,ok but the talon has heal so
flat fish#8597,idk
flat fish#8597,this man's a clown
flat fish#8597,he brought sweeper
flat fish#8597,red ward
flat fish#8597,level 1
flat fish#8597,mid
flat fish#8597,lol
flat fish#8597,i think your q does more damage then his first w but if he hitsboth he wins the trade
flat fish#8597,IF HE HITS BOTH WS
flat fish#8597,RUN
flat fish#8597,idk how loud i have to talk for you to hear me
flat fish#8597,k
flat fish#8597,if he hits you
flat fish#8597,with an ablity
flat fish#8597,you see the triangle under you
flat fish#8597,if that triangle is full
flat fish#8597,and he autos
flat fish#8597,yeah you bleed
flat fish#8597,the bleed damage is most of his damage
flat fish#8597,withotu his passive he doesn't o enough
flat fish#8597,maybe turn my user volume to 200%
flat fish#8597,idk
flat fish#8597,don't fight
flat fish#8597,he has 6
flat fish#8597,you don't
flat fish#8597,HAHAHAD
flat fish#8597,ULT
flat fish#8597,ULT
flat fish#8597,TU
flat fish#8597,TAS
flat fish#8597,yes
flat fish#8597,uhh you should have gotten hamer and tier one boots instead of tier two boots and long sword
flat fish#8597,back up
flat fish#8597,wait wtf
flat fish#8597,smurf?
flat fish#8597,well
flat fish#8597,level 5 is still pretty bad
flat fish#8597,you're level 8
flat fish#8597,usually jg is 1 level down
flat fish#8597,ok
flat fish#8597,because he has heal
flat fish#8597,you want to ignite early
flat fish#8597,so ignite should be used only if yuo're planning to kill them
flat fish#8597,and usually you ignite last because you don't know whether you can kill
flat fish#8597,yes you are
flat fish#8597,yay!
flat fish#8597,but since he has heal
flat fish#8597,ignite
flat fish#8597,early
flat fish#8597,because it reduces all healing
flat fish#8597,you're lucky
flat fish#8597,talon is bad
flat fish#8597,he could have one shot your jg
flat fish#8597,but he is
flat fish#8597,monkey
flat fish#8597,ok the point of wards is to give vision right but what are you doing with that vision you just put down
flat fish#8597,instead return to lane then ward so it lasts longer
flat fish#8597,but i mean it's whatever
flat fish#8597,yeah nce
flat fish#8597,going for jg was right play
flat fish#8597,but your jungle is also just a giraffe with a keyboard so it was 1 for 1
flat fish#8597,yeah so two q's is already a lot of damage
flat fish#8597,you want to know why zed is so good with electro? it's because q from shadow also procs electrocute
flat fish#8597,so hitting two qs and then e procs electro
flat fish#8597,electrocute is more burst if you hit three attacks or abilities in like three seconds
flat fish#8597,so it's really good on assassins
flat fish#8597,yeah
flat fish#8597,i think so
flat fish#8597,no you're too fed
flat fish#8597,he's disrespecting you by standing that far up
flat fish#8597,yeah you were 8/3
flat fish#8597,what's his kda
flat fish#8597,shes the newest campion so expect her to be broken
flat fish#8597,uh but she's fast because if she hits q
flat fish#8597,the ring around her
flat fish#8597,attack
flat fish#8597,thing
flat fish#8597,she gets movement speed
flat fish#8597,he's three levels down
flat fish#8597,the other jg
flat fish#8597,no
flat fish#8597,but sure
flat fish#8597,at least he's not blaming his team
flat fish#8597,if he was then flame big large out of him
flat fish#8597,no you can stay
flat fish#8597,get the plant
flat fish#8597,no so
flat fish#8597,there was a green plat
flat fish#8597,next to you
flat fish#8597,you can pop it for health
flat fish#8597,wait just dive him
flat fish#8597,dude
flat fish#8597,he's three levels under you
flat fish#8597,and like 6 kills down too
flat fish#8597,it's not
flat fish#8597,you won lane
flat fish#8597,hard
flat fish#8597,WAIT WHAT
flat fish#8597,PRESS TAB
flat fish#8597,AND HOLD
flat fish#8597,YOUR JG
flat fish#8597,IS 5 LEVELS DWN
flat fish#8597,well she's adc so she can do that

flat fish#8597,OK I JUST LOOKD AT YOUR OP.GG
flat fish#8597,YOUR RIVEN
flat fish#8597,THAT GAME
pitiful fish#4619,iwnj7g\aw
flat fish#8597,i didn't see her kda but she went 0/5
flat fish#8597,more
pitiful fish#4619,«╬
flat fish#8597,she built two guardian's angels
pitiful fish#4619,??????????????????????
flat fish#8597,ok let me explain
pitiful fish#4619,monkey or chimpanzee?
flat fish#8597,riven?
flat fish#8597,uh
flat fish#8597,doodoo
pitiful fish#4619,was our riven a monkey or a chimp
flat fish#8597,she was doodoo animal
flat fish#8597,so guardian's angel prevents a death
flat fish#8597,kind of
pitiful fish#4619,yeah but its 1 time
pitiful fish#4619,then theres cooldwon
pitiful fish#4619,"right
>"
flat fish#8597,yeah
flat fish#8597,she built two
flat fish#8597,it's a unique passive
pitiful fish#4619,does that give 2 revives
flat fish#8597,no
flat fish#8597,because it's unique passive
flat fish#8597,so no matter how many you build you only get one
pitiful fish#4619,retard man
flat fish#8597,but what's more monkey
flat fish#8597,"is she has long sword, boots, and potion"
pitiful fish#4619,ye
flat fish#8597,long sword and potion were probably her starting items
flat fish#8597,then she got boots
flat fish#8597,but other than that
flat fish#8597,she just built GAs
pitiful fish#4619,??????????????????????????????????????????????
pitiful fish#4619,why
flat fish#8597,exactly
flat fish#8597,monkey monkey!
pitiful fish#4619,what about our kyn
pitiful fish#4619,kayn
flat fish#8597,your kayn was building normally it looks like
pitiful fish#4619,did he just feed the lillia
flat fish#8597,but he had no gold so
flat fish#8597,yeah
flat fish#8597,he fed
pitiful fish#4619,he called for jg
pitiful fish#4619,he was 5 levels behind
flat fish#8597,poop
pitiful fish#4619,why are some players so bad
pitiful fish#4619,even worse than beginning r6 or ow players
pitiful fish#4619,isnt league supposed to be positionally like 10x more difficult than shooters
flat fish#8597,idk i think it's probably the unique controls
flat fish#8597,but also like how are you going to learn anything when the tutorial is garbage and there are 150 champions plus 70000 items and runes
pitiful fish#4619,true
flat fish#8597,k i've decided to type a bunch of things now so i don't type them while you're in game and these are harder things now but they are large
flat fish#8597,read if you want but i'll type anyway because its' 12 am and what else am i going to do
flat fish#8597,wave management is important because it helps control your enemy laner and puts you in advantageous situations
pitiful fish#4619,whats that
flat fish#8597,minions
pitiful fish#4619,so
flat fish#8597,waves refer to each group of minions that spawn
pitiful fish#4619,just kill each wave of minions?
flat fish#8597,"shoving is when you try to kill the minions as fast as possible so that your wave goes past the mid point, and usually shoving means you want to crash the wave into the turret"
flat fish#8597,this is good for a number of reasons
flat fish#8597,"the turret kills minions, so it's harder to cs"
flat fish#8597,you now have lane priority
flat fish#8597,"so you can help your jg or go ward or do whatever, while your laner has to decided between farming the wave or following you"
flat fish#8597,"sometimes they can do both, but you will arrive first to whatever you're going for"
flat fish#8597,this doesn't mean you want to perma shove
flat fish#8597,certain champs have more wave clear than others
flat fish#8597,typically mages have a lot of wave clear but champs like zed and talon can hit all the mininos and wave clear quickly too
pitiful fish#4619,so who am i in this situation
pitiful fish#4619,adc?
pitiful fish#4619,laner?
flat fish#8597,let's say you're mid
flat fish#8597,this applies to all lanes
flat fish#8597,but let's say you're mid
flat fish#8597,so you don't want to be perma shoving
pitiful fish#4619,if say im against my laner
pitiful fish#4619,i kill him
pitiful fish#4619,do i shove?
flat fish#8597,this leaves you vulnerable to enemy ganks because you are so far past the river
flat fish#8597,yes
flat fish#8597,GERNERALLY
flat fish#8597,you shove after killing your laner
pitiful fish#4619,but if i get ganked im dead
pitiful fish#4619,or they force flash
flat fish#8597,"ok this is the even minion rule: when two opposing waves have the same number and type of minions, the wave will automatically push towards the other side of the river"
flat fish#8597,does that make sense
pitiful fish#4619,no
flat fish#8597,
flat fish#8597,
flat fish#8597,in this example
flat fish#8597,both sides have three minions
flat fish#8597,but the wave is closer to red base
flat fish#8597,so it pushes towards blue base
flat fish#8597,the reason this happens
flat fish#8597,is because as the next wave comes
flat fish#8597,the wave will reach red's minions before blue's
flat fish#8597,so they kill the blue minions before the red ones die
flat fish#8597,ok?
pitiful fish#4619,y
pitiful fish#4619,e
flat fish#8597,the way the wave moves towards blue is called a slow push
flat fish#8597,usually a slow push results in multiple waves of minions groups under turret
flat fish#8597,so if both sides ignored the wave
flat fish#8597,the result might look something like this
pitiful fish#4619,wait wait so the red minions just kinda ignore the blue minions?
flat fish#8597,here this is what happens
flat fish#8597,
flat fish#8597,
flat fish#8597,
flat fish#8597,
pitiful fish#4619,the blue minions slowly back up?
flat fish#8597,no
flat fish#8597,they die
flat fish#8597,but new ones come
pitiful fish#4619,oh
pitiful fish#4619,ok
flat fish#8597,but there are more red
pitiful fish#4619,so basically red wins
flat fish#8597,yeah
pitiful fish#4619,so u should position your minion fights in a way that always gives u slow waves
flat fish#8597,well
flat fish#8597,depends
flat fish#8597,not always
flat fish#8597,so
flat fish#8597,after huge minion wwave crashes
flat fish#8597,the turret will help clean up the wave
flat fish#8597,and the new wave comes
flat fish#8597,but now
flat fish#8597,blue side minions arrive first
flat fish#8597,so it starts pushing towards red i thnink
pitiful fish#4619,so there is a reverse crash?
flat fish#8597,well
pitiful fish#4619,but if ur shoving then it shouldnt matter right
flat fish#8597,here a chapmion would help red minions slow push then crash
flat fish#8597,so let's say blue mid is zed
flat fish#8597,red mid is taalon
flat fish#8597,talon is slow pushing the wave so that he can crash a massive wave into urret
flat fish#8597,after he does this
flat fish#8597,he recalls
flat fish#8597,while he is wakling back to lane
flat fish#8597,he loses nothing
flat fish#8597,or almost nothing
flat fish#8597,"because after you crash, the wave bounces back towards the other side"
pitiful fish#4619,so he can cs
pitiful fish#4619,?
flat fish#8597,yes
flat fish#8597,he gets there in time to cs
flat fish#8597,here is probably the most important thing other than shoving though
pitiful fish#4619,and then its rinse and repeat right
flat fish#8597,well depends
flat fish#8597,ok the next wave management trick is called freezing
flat fish#8597,freezing the wave is when you keep the wave in one spot of the lane so that it doesn't move if attended to
flat fish#8597,imagine this
flat fish#8597,yuo're playing zed
flat fish#8597,you have no w
flat fish#8597,no flash
pitiful fish#4619,bad
pitiful fish#4619,but ok
flat fish#8597,and you're standing here
flat fish#8597,thats easy gank for enemy jg
flat fish#8597,why would you be up there?
flat fish#8597,well if the wave was up there and you're tring to cs
flat fish#8597,preferably
flat fish#8597,"you'd be here, safe under your turret"
flat fish#8597,so you want to freeze the wave
flat fish#8597,in order to do this
flat fish#8597,you need to make sure the wave does not hit your turret
flat fish#8597,if it does
flat fish#8597,the freeze breaks
pitiful fish#4619,wait wait
pitiful fish#4619,i dont get it
pitiful fish#4619,??????
pitiful fish#4619,how did u go from past river to under turret
pitiful fish#4619,am i dumbo
flat fish#8597,nono noon
flat fish#8597,i'm saying
flat fish#8597,imagine you're past river
flat fish#8597,that's bad
pitiful fish#4619,ye
flat fish#8597,you want to be under turret
pitiful fish#4619,oh
pitiful fish#4619,ok
flat fish#8597,so this is how you do it
pitiful fish#4619,so in order to cs while staying safe under turret u have to wave freeze?
pitiful fish#4619,oki
flat fish#8597,k i'm drawing picture
flat fish#8597,dadshed line is turret range
flat fish#8597,this is how you freeze
flat fish#8597,the three red minions are caster minions
flat fish#8597,if a wave is goign towards you
flat fish#8597,try to keep only three caster minions alive
flat fish#8597,at close to full health
flat fish#8597,let them aggro onto you
flat fish#8597,and pull them just outside of turret range
flat fish#8597,when the next wave comes
flat fish#8597,it will be frozen
pitiful fish#4619,is that just ai?
flat fish#8597,ok well
flat fish#8597,remember even minion rule
flat fish#8597,the three caster minions balance that out
flat fish#8597,so even though the wave is closer to you
flat fish#8597,normally is 6v6 minions
flat fish#8597,so it push to enemy right?
flat fish#8597,butthe 3 casters make the wave stay
flat fish#8597,cancels it out basically
pitiful fish#4619,ok
flat fish#8597,now only last hit
flat fish#8597,if you hit the wave otherwise it will break the freeze
flat fish#8597,also your opponent may try shoving you in
flat fish#8597,try don't that
pitiful fish#4619,ok
flat fish#8597,ok so now imagine this
pitiful fish#4619,i have to go now acutally
flat fish#8597,ok
flat fish#8597,i'll keep typig
flat fish#8597,so you can read in mornign
pitiful fish#4619,okok
pitiful fish#4619,bai bai!
pitiful fish#4619,eee
flat fish#8597,beeu1 !!!
flat fish#8597,ok so imagine this
flat fish#8597,you're zed vs lux
flat fish#8597,lux has no flash
flat fish#8597,if you freeze the wave
flat fish#8597,lux is basically screwed
flat fish#8597,she has no mobility
flat fish#8597,because you froze
flat fish#8597,she has to stan super far up to get experience and gold
flat fish#8597,so that's either easy gank or lux loses a lot
flat fish#8597,or your jungler actually belongs in the jungle in real life
flat fish#8597,so that's basically wave management
flat fish#8597,yay
flat fish#8597,so if you just killed your enemy laner
flat fish#8597,generally
flat fish#8597,just shove
flat fish#8597,if you're not sure tjust shove it's probably fine
flat fish#8597,but you could also try freezing then recalling
flat fish#8597,or let the wave naturally slow push towards you while you recall
flat fish#8597,basically pushing denies the enemy gold and xp because the minions die and they aren't there becasue they died
flat fish#8597,but freezing may actually give you more gold and xp
flat fish#8597,but generally
flat fish#8597,shove
flat fish#8597,sometimes you don't ahve mana
flat fish#8597,ping your jg
flat fish#8597,if they don't listen
flat fish#8597,sucks
flat fish#8597,also be careful when trying to freeze early levels
flat fish#8597,because minions do a lot of damage early levels
flat fish#8597,those 5 seconds those casters are aggro onto you deal so much
flat fish#8597,think of it this way
flat fish#8597,three caster minion shots at level one deal more damage than any auto attack in the game
flat fish#8597,"to get to level 2, it takes one wave and then a melee minion worth of xp"
flat fish#8597,when the second wave comes
flat fish#8597,try to kill a melee before them
flat fish#8597,this gives you level 2 advantage
flat fish#8597,and be ready to have level 2
flat fish#8597,so you're ready to jump onto them with your level advantage
flat fish#8597,and this isn't just a level advantage like lvl 10 vs 9
flat fish#8597,this is bigger because you also have anotehr ability to fight with
flat fish#8597,same goes with level 6 powerspike
flat fish#8597,pay attention to your xp bar and try to get 6 before them
flat fish#8597,this gives you ult
flat fish#8597,"again immediately use your ult advantage to push them away from the wave, deny them some xp"
flat fish#8597,because if they fight you lvl 5 vs 6 it's really int
flat fish#8597,talon has really big level 2 powerspike
flat fish#8597,unless he's in a really bad matchup
flat fish#8597,two ws and q plus auto attack at level two can delete half your health bar
flat fish#8597,(because he gets passive proc and electrocute proc)
flat fish#8597,thans fo r cmo te talk
flat fish#8597,_)_)
flat fish#8597,oh also you should shove before you roam
pitiful fish#4619,wait
pitiful fish#4619,i can play at 4
pitiful fish#4619,kk?
flat fish#8597,kkkkk
flat fish#8597,k actually i have a class
flat fish#8597,at 4
flat fish#8597,i forgot
flat fish#8597,yo do you want to play league

flat fish#8597,i think
pitiful fish#4619,ok
pitiful fish#4619,where do i find the vids
pitiful fish#4619,when does he send them
flat fish#8597,one should be sent in like 3 minues
flat fish#8597,but he only sends one per day for a few weeks then once a week so that he has time to make more
flat fish#8597,because his course is only like 50% complete
pitiful fish#4619,ok wait so
pitiful fish#4619,i signed up
pitiful fish#4619,i just made a vimeo
pitiful fish#4619,where it gonna be
flat fish#8597,a vimeo?
flat fish#8597,uh
pitiful fish#4619,it says he uses that
pitiful fish#4619,oh i see it
pitiful fish#4619,im dumbo
flat fish#8597,like you made a vimeo account
flat fish#8597,ok
flat fish#8597,i already like his more than sant petburger's but i wish i could do more than one a day
flat fish#8597,well maybe one a day is good
pitiful fish#4619,yo where is it
pitiful fish#4619,does he send it on email
pitiful fish#4619,i dont see it uet
flat fish#8597,email
flat fish#8597,he send another
pitiful fish#4619,oh
pitiful fish#4619,ok
flat fish#8597,kinda weird how you don't need like any registration
flat fish#8597,like you can enter anyone's email and they start getting japanese lessons
flat fish#8597,so what'd you thikn of his course
pitiful fish#4619,havent looked at it yet
flat fish#8597,k i found a profile picture
pitiful fish#4619,yay
pitiful fish#4619,jongy
flat fish#8597,it's one of the things i have from church where we would get stickers and put them on these nametags and spend them on shopping day
flat fish#8597,it's from 4 years ago idk why i kept it
flat fish#8597,so what do you think of the course
flat fish#8597,lmao
flat fish#8597,first one in the course how to make japanese sentence with one word
flat fish#8597,second one
flat fish#8597,
flat fish#8597,
flat fish#8597,there is a speedrun to make an oompa loompa in mii maker
flat fish#8597,have you ever seen me type :=
flat fish#8597,well
flat fish#8597,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN2TTiGpDvM
flat fish#8597,idk anyone else who programs so im sending it to you
pitiful fish#4619,looks like a face
flat fish#8597,thats why i type it lol
pitiful fish#4619,:=
flat fish#8597,but python did larger with it
pitiful fish#4619,x := 42
pitiful fish#4619,so if i type
pitiful fish#4619,that
pitiful fish#4619,how does it return 42
pitiful fish#4619,???????
pitiful fish#4619,isnt it just an operator?
pitiful fish#4619,whats the code behind it
flat fish#8597,no so
flat fish#8597,x = 42 assigns 42 to x
pitiful fish#4619,yes
flat fish#8597,but if you do like if (x =42) == 42:
flat fish#8597,that doesn't work
flat fish#8597,you need if (x := 42) == 42:
flat fish#8597,so first it asssigns 42 to x
flat fish#8597,then wherever the statement is
pitiful fish#4619,so basically
pitiful fish#4619,what its saying
flat fish#8597,it replaces that with whatever the value is
pitiful fish#4619,"""if (42 is assigned to x which is also the value which is returned) is 42"""
pitiful fish#4619,while
pitiful fish#4619,x = 42 doesnt give a returning value
pitiful fish#4619,so u cant use it in a conditional statement?
pitiful fish#4619,is that right?
flat fish#8597,you can't use it in any statement
flat fish#8597,i think
pitiful fish#4619,yeah
pitiful fish#4619,ok

pitiful fish#4619,"An absolute monarch is defined to be a ruler who “is not limited or restrained by laws or a constitution” (dictionary.com). After the numerous religious conflicts set in motion by the Protestant Reformation combined with the decline of feudalism and the rise of the middle class, the absolute monarchs of the 17th century ruled without obstruction, setting laws and keeping order in any way they saw fit. Typically, absolute monarchs justified their power by believing that their authority was bestowed upon them by a religious deity—a so-called “divine right.” The effects of absolutism can be clearly seen in Russia during the reign of Peter the Great, who ruled between 1682 and 1725. During his opulent reign, Peter completely changed the culture of Russia, managed to modernize a country still in the Middle Ages into a respectable European power, and began the construction of the extravagant city of St. Petersburg, demonstrating that Peter, in fact, was the greatest absolute monarch."

flat fish#8597,"A further problem is the susceptibility of RNA to base-catalyzed hydrolysis at pH >6 [35]. The phosphodiester bonds of the RNA backbone and the ester bond between tRNAs and amino acids – something similar to which would have been critical for the evolution of ribosomal protein synthesis – are both more stable at pH 4–5 [5, 6]. With our proposal for RNA world evolution at acidic pH [5], we have suggested that the primordial ‘soup’ may have been more like vinaigrette, while Hanczyc [36] has drawn a comparison with mayonnaise, with its emulsified mixture of oil in water (in light of these, could there be potential for food science to provide insights for origin of life studies?) While Mg2+ is important for stabilizing RNA secondary and tertiary structure, high Mg2+ concentrations also catalyze RNA degradation, which has been identified as a particular problem in the case of RNA template copying [21]. Here too, acidic pH offers a possible solution, as the positive charge on protonated cytosine and adenosine residues in acidic conditions may reduce the requirement for divalent cations. For example, a self-cleaving ribozyme with maximum activity at pH 4 isolated by in vitro selection, is active in the absence of divalent ions (including Mg2+) [37]. RNA secondary (and tertiary) structure would appear to be compatible with the presence of protonated nucleotides, as we have found an increased number of potentially protonated A-C base pair ‘mismatches’ in the tRNAs from acidophilic archaeal species with reported cytoplasmic pHs of 4.6-6.2 [5]."

flat fish#8597,"Heraclitus Readings
Heraclitus' Fragments B1, B50, B54, B57, B59, B60:
B1 (Sextus Empiricus, Against the mathematicians, VII, 132):
Though this Word is true evermore, yet men are as unable to understand it when they hear it for the first time as before they have heard it at all. For, though, all things come to pass in accordance with this Word, men seem as if they had no experience of them, when they make trial of words and deeds such as I set forth, dividing each thing according to its nature and showing how it truly is. But other men know not what they are doing when awake, even as they forget what they do in sleep.
B50 (Hippolytus, Refutation of all heresies, IX, 9, 1):
It is wise to hearken, not to me, but to my Word, and to confess that all things are one.
B54 (Hippolytus, Refutation of all heresies, IX, 9, 5):
The unseen harmony is better than the visible.
B57 (Hippolytus, Refutation of all heresies, IX, 10, 2):
Hesiod is most men's teacher. Men think he knew very many things, a man who did not know day or night! They are one.
B59 (Hippolytus, Refutation of all heresies, IX, 9, 4):
The straight and the crooked path of the fuller’s comb is one and the same.
B60 (Hippolytus, Refutation of all heresies, IX, 10, 4):
The way up and the way down is one and the same.

flat fish#8597,"A tarot deck consists of $78$ cards. There are $14$ cards in each of $4$ suits (comprising the usual $13$ ranks and a face card called a knight), and there are $21$ picture cards and a joker. The picture cards and the joker do not belong to any suit.
A tarot hand consists of $18$ cards drawn at random from the deck. What is the probability that a tarot hand has a void, meaning that at least one suit is not present among the $18$ cards? Once you've computed the answer in terms of binomial coefficients, use a calculator or computer to determine the answer to the nearest tenth of a percent, and enter that as your answer."

flat fish#8597,some people build 6 infinity edges in urf
flat fish#8597,because it's fun to do that
flat fish#8597,ie has most ad in the game so it's fun to build it even if like armor penetration would do more damage
flat fish#8597,and it's not gold efficient because it gives 25% crit so after 4 that's wasted and it gives 25% extra crit damage as a unique passive so that's wasted everytime you buy another one
flat fish#8597,k i've realized everytime league comes up i just write a multiparagraph essay no one cares about
flat fish#8597,but it's
flat fish#8597,like

pitiful fish#4619,they do hard translations
pitiful fish#4619,and they go fat

flat fish#8597,?
flat fish#8597,a/aA
pitiful fish#4619,a lot of vocab
flat fish#8597,ok
flat fish#8597,are they what yuta talk about with the textbook style of japanese learnign
pitiful fish#4619,no
pitiful fish#4619,yes
pitiful fish#4619,yes
pitiful fish#4619,its hard
flat fish#8597,b auhf kkk -
flat fish#8597,ok
pitiful fish#4619,u can audit the course i guess
pitiful fish#4619,starts very easy
flat fish#8597,audit?
pitiful fish#4619,lesson 3 and 4 are very hard
pitiful fish#4619,stays hard until the end
flat fish#8597,i think i got to week 4
flat fish#8597,then i had to take history of music
flat fish#8597,which was fun course i guess and the teacher was a really nice guy but i didn't enjoy it because really it was my dad's idea
pitiful fish#4619,is your dad a musician
flat fish#8597,no
pitiful fish#4619,does he want u to do music or somehting
pitiful fish#4619,
pitiful fish#4619,how do b
flat fish#8597,no he's ok with me doing software engineering but he says now is an important time to explore other things and learn about humanity and arts because if i learn all the computer science now what am i going to learn in college which makes no sense i think but
flat fish#8597,wtf
flat fish#8597,find the funcition
pitiful fish#4619,if its not x+1 in the top then there would be another x-intercept
pitiful fish#4619,so the only possible solution is x+1
flat fish#8597,will you read another essay from me if i write one
flat fish#8597,so you and ian got the first kill because they didn't respect your level 2 advantage
flat fish#8597,to get level two in botlane you need one wave and three melees from the next one
flat fish#8597,when you're close to level 2 in the lane and you know your opponents will still be level 1
flat fish#8597,stand far up to pressure them
flat fish#8597,if they fight you usually they are just inting because usually there's no way they win

flat fish#8597,but also
flat fish#8597,sometimes i wonder if it's just talon in low elo
flat fish#8597,because this talon one trick smurfed one game in bronze
flat fish#8597,so probably like 98% chance he'll win right
flat fish#8597,except talon can't do that
flat fish#8597,low elo does'n tknow how to end
flat fish#8597,and then talon is just useless
flat fish#8597,even if he went 7/3/1 in lane
flat fish#8597,so he lost that game
flat fish#8597,in bronze
flat fish#8597,as a challenger player
flat fish#8597,it's a big problem because you can't really trust your team to end quickly enough so if you take the kills you fall off eventually but if you give them to your team you're trusting they don't belong in the jungle in real life

pitiful fish#4619,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWQacyKoiT0
flat fish#8597,do they teach basically everything but informal
pitiful fish#4619,idk
pitiful fish#4619,informal isnt hard
pitiful fish#4619,but there are more endings
flat fish#8597,what's the da you hear at the end of sentences
pitiful fish#4619,
pitiful fish#4619,
flat fish#8597,is that an online textbook?
flat fish#8597,is there a link
pitiful fish#4619,yeah
pitiful fish#4619,http://www.guidetojapanese.org/grammar_guide.pdf
flat fish#8597,has all the kanji you've seen been words from traditional chinese writing
pitiful fish#4619,nope
pitiful fish#4619,沢山
pitiful fish#4619,takusan
pitiful fish#4619,"""a lot"""
pitiful fish#4619,i think its old chinese
pitiful fish#4619,and
pitiful fish#4619,寝る
flat fish#8597,i thought 願 was just a japanese thing but i realized it was probabl traditional
pitiful fish#4619,no
pitiful fish#4619,"thats ""yuan liang"""
pitiful fish#4619,yuan
pitiful fish#4619,anyways
pitiful fish#4619,寝る means sleep
pitiful fish#4619,"but the word is ""chen"""
pitiful fish#4619,when i asked my mom she told me
flat fish#8597,ok yeah but the characters are chinese right
pitiful fish#4619,its a really old way to say sleep
pitiful fish#4619,no
pitiful fish#4619,not all of them
flat fish#8597,ok
pitiful fish#4619,some of them are purely chinese made
pitiful fish#4619,japanese*
pitiful fish#4619,purely japanese
flat fish#8597,願 is not 愿? like yuan'yi
flat fish#8597,it's yuan'liang you said
pitiful fish#4619,wait
pitiful fish#4619,might not be
pitiful fish#4619,give it a sec
pitiful fish#4619,give me a se
pitiful fish#4619,c]
flat fish#8597,yuan'liang is 原谅
flat fish#8597,in simplfied
pitiful fish#4619,oh
pitiful fish#4619,im dumb
pitiful fish#4619,its yuan
pitiful fish#4619,like
pitiful fish#4619,"""willing"""
flat fish#8597,yuan yi
flat fish#8597,yeah
pitiful fish#4619,"""yuan yi"""
pitiful fish#4619,yea
flat fish#8597,nice
flat fish#8597,why does ikura (how expensive) not need desu
pitiful fish#4619,?
pitiful fish#4619,just a question
pitiful fish#4619,doesnt need to be really polite
flat fish#8597,i'm learning from duolingo
flat fish#8597,they didn't say question words didn't need desu
flat fish#8597,so same for like
flat fish#8597,dare right
flat fish#8597,
pitiful fish#4619,flatty fish
flat fish#8597,wow
flat fish#8597,learning past tense
flat fish#8597,wo
flat fish#8597,peok
flat fish#8597,okwp2ko
pitiful fish#4619,wow
flat fish#8597,if i just learn formal
flat fish#8597,is it easy to learn informal after
pitiful fish#4619,nope
pitiful fish#4619,very different
flat fish#8597,what's します vs してます
pitiful fish#4619,?
pitiful fish#4619,shite?
pitiful fish#4619,shite is te form of suru
pitiful fish#4619,u cant do shitemasu
pitiful fish#4619,u know what te-form does?
flat fish#8597,no lol
pitiful fish#4619,"https://www.thoughtco.com/the-japanese-verb-form-te-2027918#:~:text=~Te%20Form%3A%20Present%20Progressive&text=The%20present%20progressive%20is%20used,iru%22%20or%20%22imasu%22."
pitiful fish#4619,these are just some
flat fish#8597,i just searched して vs し and what i first asked you is the first result
pitiful fish#4619,ok so
pitiful fish#4619,shi
pitiful fish#4619,"is the ""verb stem"" of the verb する"
pitiful fish#4619,"the ""verb stem"" is how most textbooks refer to it"
pitiful fish#4619,attaching -masu at the end puts it in the polite form
pitiful fish#4619,”食べる”
pitiful fish#4619,”食べます”
pitiful fish#4619,”する”
pitiful fish#4619,”します”
pitiful fish#4619,"u always use the ""dictionary form"""
pitiful fish#4619,"which are the ones that end with ""...u"""
flat fish#8597,k
pitiful fish#4619,there are 2 kinds of verbs
pitiful fish#4619,-ru verbs
pitiful fish#4619,and -u verbs
pitiful fish#4619,some -u end with -ru
flat fish#8597,isn't there another irregular type
pitiful fish#4619,theres only 3
pitiful fish#4619,i dont really care about those
pitiful fish#4619,u can usually tell if its a -ru verb if the last vowel sound before the -u is -e or -i
pitiful fish#4619,anyways
pitiful fish#4619,"u always use the ""dictionary form"" when speaking informal"
flat fish#8597,so like
flat fish#8597,taberu
pitiful fish#4619,yeah
pitiful fish#4619,thats complete
pitiful fish#4619,does that make sense?
pitiful fish#4619,now
flat fish#8597,wait let me read about the te form
flat fish#8597,ok
pitiful fish#4619,"in order to conjugate the ""dictionary form"" into past tense u conjugate to the ""ta-form"""
pitiful fish#4619,which u need to memorize
pitiful fish#4619,the te-form just replaces the ta from the ta-form with te
pitiful fish#4619,so like
pitiful fish#4619,tabeta becomes tabete
pitiful fish#4619,asobu becomes asonde
pitiful fish#4619,(asonda in past tense)
flat fish#8597,ok
pitiful fish#4619,the thing is
pitiful fish#4619,the te-form by itself doesnt really make any sense
pitiful fish#4619,"one of the uses is the ""present progressive"""
pitiful fish#4619,which is
pitiful fish#4619,"""i am eating"" vs ""i eat"""
pitiful fish#4619,i am eating -> tabeteiru
pitiful fish#4619,or just
pitiful fish#4619,colloquially
pitiful fish#4619,tabeteru
pitiful fish#4619,youll hear this a lot in anime
pitiful fish#4619,"this is called the ""te-iru"" or ""te-imasu"" form"
pitiful fish#4619,"where u just add the verb ""iru"" to the end of the te-form of a verb"
pitiful fish#4619,"it doesnt directly translate to ""-ing"" though"
pitiful fish#4619,like
pitiful fish#4619,for the verb
pitiful fish#4619,知る
pitiful fish#4619,to know
flat fish#8597,what's the hiragana
pitiful fish#4619,"if u want to say ""i know"""
pitiful fish#4619,shiru
flat fish#8597,k
pitiful fish#4619,知っている
pitiful fish#4619,"means ""i know"""
pitiful fish#4619,so basically
pitiful fish#4619,"the verb ""shiru"" refers to the act of beginning to know something"
flat fish#8597,the act of beginning to know something
pitiful fish#4619,"so therefore, shitteiru literally means ""i already have performed the action of beginning to know something and am now existing in the state of knowing something"""
flat fish#8597,wait wait
flat fish#8597,let me figure it out
flat fish#8597,so shiru is the act of beginning to know something
flat fish#8597,so shite
pitiful fish#4619,"the textbook i sent u actually refers to the te-iru form as the ""enduring"" state"
pitiful fish#4619,shitte
pitiful fish#4619,i think
flat fish#8597,oh yeah forgot the small tsu
flat fish#8597,ok
flat fish#8597,so shitte
pitiful fish#4619,so its already happened and is now enduring
pitiful fish#4619,which makes it a little easier to think about
pitiful fish#4619,i mean technically
pitiful fish#4619,when u say
pitiful fish#4619,"""i know"""
pitiful fish#4619,u mean
flat fish#8597,ki think i undersatnd what shitte would be but idk how to say it literally
pitiful fish#4619,ok
pitiful fish#4619,ok
pitiful fish#4619,yeah
pitiful fish#4619,its weird
flat fish#8597,i am performing the action of beginning to know something
flat fish#8597,iru is exist right?
pitiful fish#4619,"u asked me ""shitemasu"
pitiful fish#4619,""""
pitiful fish#4619,yeah
pitiful fish#4619,iru is exist
pitiful fish#4619,its weird because iru refers to people or animals but
pitiful fish#4619,not for te-form
pitiful fish#4619,anyways
flat fish#8597,so with iru then is i am performing the the action of beginning to know something and i exist as knowing it
pitiful fish#4619,yes
flat fish#8597,oh you'ev already performed the action of beginning to know something
flat fish#8597,what
pitiful fish#4619,yes
pitiful fish#4619,already performed
flat fish#8597,you've already performed it?
pitiful fish#4619,it describes the state of you already knowing something
flat fish#8597,isn't it progressive
pitiful fish#4619,nono
flat fish#8597,though
pitiful fish#4619,see
pitiful fish#4619,"thats why the ""present progressive"" is ambiguous"
pitiful fish#4619,"when u say ""i know"""
pitiful fish#4619,dont u mean
pitiful fish#4619,"""i am knowing?"""
pitiful fish#4619,which implies
pitiful fish#4619,that u learned it before
pitiful fish#4619,and are therefore
pitiful fish#4619,existing
pitiful fish#4619,in the state of knowing this something
pitiful fish#4619,"but nobody says ""i am knowing"""
pitiful fish#4619,"same with ""live"
pitiful fish#4619,""""
pitiful fish#4619,like
pitiful fish#4619,in
pitiful fish#4619,"""i live in palo alto"""
pitiful fish#4619,is the same as
pitiful fish#4619,"""i am living in palo alto"""
flat fish#8597,"but i thought shiru meant ""beginning to know something"""
pitiful fish#4619,no
pitiful fish#4619,not exactly
pitiful fish#4619,dont think about direct translates
flat fish#8597,"so you wouldn't be ""in the progress of knowing"" you would be ""in progress of beginning to know'"
pitiful fish#4619,just vaguely imagine the verb shiru to mean the action of knowing
pitiful fish#4619,then it will make more sense
pitiful fish#4619,im telling u
pitiful fish#4619,learning japanese is like learning a new way of thought
flat fish#8597,"i thoguht ""act of beginning to know something"" was the vague trasnlation lol"
pitiful fish#4619,no
pitiful fish#4619,thats only in application with the te form
pitiful fish#4619,"if u just say ""shiru"""
pitiful fish#4619,then
pitiful fish#4619,its like
pitiful fish#4619,idek
pitiful fish#4619,lemme ask kai
flat fish#8597,you want to vc for this
pitiful fish#4619,
pitiful fish#4619,"so i guess it is kinda ""beginning to know something"""
flat fish#8597,is te form always iwht iru or imasu?
pitiful fish#4619,no
pitiful fish#4619,u can have -te kudasai
pitiful fish#4619,u can use te form for linking multiple verbs
pitiful fish#4619,u can sometimes use just te form by itself for imperative
pitiful fish#4619,u can see all this in anime
flat fish#8597,not in real life?
flat fish#8597,so te form means in the progress of like tabete and mitei but then what makes shitte mean i know
flat fish#8597,what's 話せ vs 話し
pitiful fish#4619,hanasu is the dictionary form
pitiful fish#4619,i think
pitiful fish#4619,hanase can be the imperative
pitiful fish#4619,or the potential
pitiful fish#4619,chapter 3.11.4 is very importatn
pitiful fish#4619,in the textbook
pitiful fish#4619,flatty fish
flat fish#8597,pathetic fish
pitiful fish#4619,flappy fish

flat fish#8597,is there a system you know of how the numbers change for each counter or is it necessary to memorize all of them separately
pitiful fish#4619,uh
pitiful fish#4619,nope
pitiful fish#4619,"With quantities from one to ten, this problem can often be sidestepped by using the traditional numbers (see below), which can quantify many nouns without help. For example, ""four apples"" is りんご四個 ringo yonko where 個 ko is the counter, but can also be expressed, using the traditional numeral four, as りんご四つ ringo yottsu."

pitiful fish#4619,just these
flat fish#8597,oh
flat fish#8597,those are only counters?
flat fish#8597,but what about　冊
pitiful fish#4619,nono
pitiful fish#4619,i mean
pitiful fish#4619,ones where the usage is exception
pitiful fish#4619,"one person is hitori, two is futari"
flat fish#8597,the ones where thaey change?
flat fish#8597,oh
pitiful fish#4619,"but the others are sanjin, shijin, etc."
flat fish#8597,i'm not getting it
pitiful fish#4619,so
pitiful fish#4619,usually
pitiful fish#4619,"its like ""noun number counter"""
pitiful fish#4619,in the cheat i showed between 1-10 u can just use tsu for the counter
pitiful fish#4619,"the exceptions i mentioned apply only to the ""noun number counter"" rule"
pitiful fish#4619,so
pitiful fish#4619,like
pitiful fish#4619,一個
pitiful fish#4619,二個
pitiful fish#4619,三個
pitiful fish#4619,四個
pitiful fish#4619,"where its ""number counter"""
pitiful fish#4619,but
flat fish#8597,ah ok
flat fish#8597,so like
pitiful fish#4619,一人
flat fish#8597,time
flat fish#8597,is a thing
pitiful fish#4619,二人
flat fish#8597,time is special
flat fish#8597,you can't just say one thing
flat fish#8597,right?
pitiful fish#4619,三人
pitiful fish#4619,四人
pitiful fish#4619,hitori
pitiful fish#4619,futari
pitiful fish#4619,sannin

flat fish#8597,https://www.mondly.com/blog/2019/11/22/count-in-japanese-a-complete-guide-to-japanese-numbers/
flat fish#8597,it says there are 7 counters you should know
flat fish#8597,so you were saying those are the ones to memorize
pitiful fish#4619,oh yeah
pitiful fish#4619,because
pitiful fish#4619,they teach
pitiful fish#4619,yon
flat fish#8597,and the others can be replaced with tsu?
pitiful fish#4619,and nana
flat fish#8597,huuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
flat fish#8597,hey i just learned the word for between too
pitiful fish#4619,ur already there?
pitiful fish#4619,nice
pitiful fish#4619,its not that good actually
flat fish#8597,position
pitiful fish#4619,some of that stuff u wouldnt actually say
pitiful fish#4619,but its easier to learn it as a direct translation
flat fish#8597,"idk i just mentioned it because i remember you were like ""hey kai ijust learned the word for between... i am between your mother and father"""
pitiful fish#4619,yeah
flat fish#8597,but wdym some of that stuff i wouldn't actually say
pitiful fish#4619,"theres two ""between""s in japanese"
pitiful fish#4619,one for similar objecys
pitiful fish#4619,one for different objects
flat fish#8597,waa
pitiful fish#4619,duolingo treats them the same
flat fish#8597,who even decides to make two words for that
pitiful fish#4619,idk
pitiful fish#4619,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
pitiful fish#4619,dont think of it as direct translate
flat fish#8597,what's the stroke order for aida
pitiful fish#4619,just imagine each thing to have a vague meaning
flat fish#8597,door in traditional chinese
pitiful fish#4619,then it will make more senese
pitiful fish#4619,idk
flat fish#8597,yeah yeah i know
pitiful fish#4619,uh
pitiful fish#4619,how can i show u
flat fish#8597,just
flat fish#8597,say like
flat fish#8597,shu
flat fish#8597,heng zhe
flat fish#8597,heng
flat fish#8597,heng
pitiful fish#4619,how do u usually write ti
flat fish#8597,what's ti
pitiful fish#4619,it
flat fish#8597,it
flat fish#8597,watch
pitiful fish#4619,wrong
pitiful fish#4619,i think
flat fish#8597,actually
flat fish#8597,i go between like
pitiful fish#4619,this how i write it
flat fish#8597,two different ways
flat fish#8597,kinda random each time
flat fish#8597,ok
flat fish#8597,that makes more sense probably
flat fish#8597,even so the heng zhe gou is kinda weird to write
flat fish#8597,what's your method of learning chinese
flat fish#8597,ji; majpen
flat fish#8597,japnes
flat fish#8597,jp
flat fish#8597,ij
flat fish#8597,i knew it was important to read and actually take in content in the language you're learning but i thought you only did yuta's lessons
flat fish#8597,you said it's important to listen to the same thing over and over too right
flat fish#8597,wait that's what mme kandell did with french songs
flat fish#8597,but you can't get every rule of the language from content so you take yuta's lessons for that? and grammar book
flat fish#8597,how is te form annoying? the song about it you sent says there's one exception
pitiful fish#4619,memorizing the entire thing
pitiful fish#4619,and applying it subconciously when ur writing or saying something
flat fish#8597,idk seems pretty straightfoward to me
flat fish#8597,but i've never done it
flat fish#8597,so
flat fish#8597,so here's what i'm planning to do right so i'll read the grammar book and watch anime and maybe read things i can find? is that good
pitiful fish#4619,read yotsuba
pitiful fish#4619,find a jpop artist that u like
pitiful fish#4619,ask kai about words
pitiful fish#4619,it can be spontaneous
pitiful fish#4619,actually
flat fish#8597,is that the manga you showed me
pitiful fish#4619,doing it spontaneous makes it better ingrained in ur head
pitiful fish#4619,no
pitiful fish#4619,i mean
pitiful fish#4619,i guess u can read komi but it will be harder
flat fish#8597,where did you get the vocab though
flat fish#8597,did oyu just search each thing as they came up
pitiful fish#4619,no
pitiful fish#4619,"reading, listening"
pitiful fish#4619,theres words
pitiful fish#4619,i ask kai before i consult a ictionaruy
pitiful fish#4619,because getting confirmation from 2 sources is better than 1
flat fish#8597,so you just found the meaning of word as they camp up
pitiful fish#4619,usually i dont remember them but if i see them again and ask again i remember them again
pitiful fish#4619,and better
flat fish#8597,oh jisho is really good
flat fish#8597,.org
flat fish#8597,w
flat fish#8597,do you actually watch japanese to learn new words or do oyu watch it to just see where you're at
flat fish#8597,alright 350 page textbook read is probably a bit helpful right
flat fish#8597,i mean maybe it's a waste of time but it's not bad right
flat fish#8597,i'll just do it see what happens like imagine i'm not learning japanese when i'm reading the textbook but i'm just having fun reading a textbook
flat fish#8597,are skins easy to get in overwatch?
flat fish#8597,seems like you guys have one for each
flat fish#8597,or multiple
flat fish#8597,yeah league basically needs you to buy things if you want to get what you want probably because it's free and there are 150 champions with average 4 skins each to randomly get
pitiful fish#4619,hey fanatical fish
flat fish#8597,perpetuous fish
pitiful fish#4619,what are u doing
flat fish#8597,nothing so far
flat fish#8597,just ate breakfast
flat fish#8597,probably today will first finish school work and do philosophy class
flat fish#8597,and read the textbook
pitiful fish#4619,ok
flat fish#8597,what about you
flat fish#8597,oh yeah and we're planning to watch the bunny girl senpai movie idk if you want to do that it's with hahn ben noam and maybe remi
pitiful fish#4619,sure
pitiful fish#4619,when
flat fish#8597,they haven't answered
flat fish#8597,i can ask again
flat fish#8597,"ボブは⿂が好きだ
why is the だ there"
pitiful fish#4619,because
pitiful fish#4619,wait
pitiful fish#4619,is that in the textbook
pitiful fish#4619,oh yeah

flat fish#8597,can't you just say like
flat fish#8597,ボブは学生
flat fish#8597,and you don't need the だ
pitiful fish#4619,go to the chapter in the textbook
pitiful fish#4619,it says
pitiful fish#4619,a state of being can be implied without using da
pitiful fish#4619,right
pitiful fish#4619,so the da just makes it more declarative
pitiful fish#4619,scroll to the chapter
pitiful fish#4619,it explains ti
flat fish#8597,so for bob likes fish do you need the だ
flat fish#8597,no?
flat fish#8597,movie is at 7 btw if you want to come

flat fish#8597,bard in league where if you see a bard main
flat fish#8597,you know their career is a meme
flat fish#8597,because they play bard
flat fish#8597,bard isn't bad and most bard mains are really good but they're also bard mains so that's really bard main
flat fish#8597,you know

flat fish#8597,i finished reading chapter 3 basic grammar but please explain the difference between conjugating んだ or adding it to the end i don't understand
flat fish#8597,which is which
flat fish#8597,"ok so like 学生じゃないんだ is ""the thing is, i am not a student"" and 学生なんじゃない is"
flat fish#8597,"""the thing isn't that i am a student""?"
flat fish#8597,"oh and then it would continue like ""i am (actually) a teacher"""
pitiful fish#4619,+ is like (nan)
pitiful fish#4619,Q
pitiful fish#4619,~(Q+)
pitiful fish#4619,(~Q)+
flat fish#8597,what does that mean
flat fish#8597,this game seems very stressful
flat fish#8597,the textbook says you can use か to make sarcastic remarks
pitiful fish#4619,whwe
pitiful fish#4619,where
pitiful fish#4619,show me
flat fish#8597,
pitiful fish#4619,oh
pitiful fish#4619,thats only special cases though
pitiful fish#4619,like
flat fish#8597,oh
pitiful fish#4619,asking something in a question way in a sentence to make it seem like it means the opposite meaning
pitiful fish#4619,explaining sarcasm is impossible
pitiful fish#4619,did u memorize all the vocab
pitiful fish#4619,for verbs
flat fish#8597,what like
flat fish#8597,uh
flat fish#8597,nvm

pitiful fish#4619,do it
pitiful fish#4619,its really helpful
flat fish#8597,verbs only
flat fish#8597,?
pitiful fish#4619,no
pitiful fish#4619,all the vocab
pitiful fish#4619,theres not that much
pitiful fish#4619,and theyre really commonly used words
flat fish#8597,yeah but i don't really want to go through the lists
pitiful fish#4619,bruh
flat fish#8597,i'd rather take in japanese content
flat fish#8597,to do that
flat fish#8597,or does that not
pitiful fish#4619,u need a start somehwere
pitiful fish#4619,though
flat fish#8597,yeah
pitiful fish#4619,u cant go from 0 to more than 0
flat fish#8597,i memorized like
pitiful fish#4619,only when u know a few words u can start building upon that
flat fish#8597,bruh you were  telling me to just start watching anime and reading
pitiful fish#4619,thats why i can sometimes make out phrases or even sentences in anime or songs
flat fish#8597,and not to read the textbook
pitiful fish#4619,well
pitiful fish#4619,yeah
pitiful fish#4619,but
pitiful fish#4619,i mean i guess
pitiful fish#4619,well anyways just know the vocab is there
pitiful fish#4619,those should be well memorized anyways
pitiful fish#4619,textbook or not
flat fish#8597,no i'm reading a grammar textbook so i know what to look for in a japanese sentence when i'm doing the reading or watching anime
pitiful fish#4619,ok
pitiful fish#4619,sure
flat fish#8597,becuase like
pitiful fish#4619,yeah thats fair
flat fish#8597,then i know what's vocab and not particles or other things and where it's being used yeah
flat fish#8597,have you looked at the hentai
flat fish#8597,a?AA?
flat fish#8597,ok
flat fish#8597,a

flat fish#8597,coding is like brute forcing the math problems
flat fish#8597,yeah i'm just saying
flat fish#8597,yeah i wa sjust saying
flat fish#8597,but also
flat fish#8597,yeah you don't do that
flat fish#8597,coding can solve the problem in the slower way
flat fish#8597,which is brute force but also sometimes  there is no fast method
flat fish#8597,i said it's because you actually like art
flat fish#8597,not logic and algorithms
flat fish#8597,also you said you wanted to do art
flat fish#8597,that's why i said
flat fish#8597,probalby gay too
flat fish#8597,"i went to an english class where they introduced us to a lot of dead poets and basically all of them were gay, committed suicide, or divorced which is probably not a coincidence"
flat fish#8597,japanese exceptions are weird because they remind you that you're actually playing with legos

pitiful fish#4619,wait
pitiful fish#4619,problem 1?
pitiful fish#4619,it doesnt work/
flat fish#8597,i'm on 3rd problem
pitiful fish#4619,can u send me problem
flat fish#8597,"Given a list of distinct positive integers named pegs representing the location of each peg along the support beam, write a function solution(pegs) which, if there is a solution, returns a list of two positive integers a and b representing the numerator and denominator of the first gear's radius in its simplest form in order to achieve the goal above, such that radius = a/b. The ratio a/b should be greater than or equal to 1. Not all support configurations will necessarily be capable of creating the proper rotation ratio, so if the task is impossible, the function solution(pegs) should return the list [-1, -1].
For example, if the pegs are placed at [4, 30, 50], then the first gear could have a radius of 12, the second gear could have a radius of 14, and the last one a radius of 6. Thus, the last gear would rotate twice as fast as the first one. In this case, pegs would be [4, 30, 50] and solution(pegs) should return [12, 1].
The list pegs will be given sorted in ascending order and will contain at least 2 and no more than 20 distinct positive integers, all between 1 and 10000 inclusive."

pitiful fish#4619,"Running with Bunnies
====================
You and your rescued bunny prisoners need to get out of this collapsing death trap of a space station - and fast! Unfortunately, some of the bunnies have been weakened by their long imprisonment and can't run very fast. Their friends are trying to help them, but this escape would go a lot faster if you also pitched in. The defensive bulkhead doors have begun to close, and if you don't make it through in time, you'll be trapped! You need to grab as many bunnies as you can and get through the bulkheads before they close.
The time it takes to move from your starting point to all of the bunnies and to the bulkhead will be given to you in a square matrix of integers. Each row will tell you the time it takes to get to the start, first bunny, second bunny, ..., last bunny, and the bulkhead in that order. The order of the rows follows the same pattern (start, each bunny, bulkhead). The bunnies can jump into your arms, so picking them up is instantaneous, and arriving at the bulkhead at the same time as it seals still allows for a successful, if dramatic, escape. (Don't worry, any bunnies you don't pick up will be able to escape with you since they no longer have to carry the ones you did pick up.) You can revisit different spots if you wish, and moving to the bulkhead doesn't mean you have to immediately leave - you can move to and from the bulkhead to pick up additional bunnies if time permits.
In addition to spending time traveling between bunnies, some paths interact with the space station's security checkpoints and add time back to the clock. Adding time to the clock will delay the closing of the bulkhead doors, and if the time goes back up to 0 or a positive number after the doors have already closed, it triggers the bulkhead to reopen. Therefore, it might be possible to walk in a circle and keep gaining time: that is, each time a path is traversed, the same amount of time is used or added."
pitiful fish#4619,"Write a function of the form solution(times, time_limit) to calculate the most bunnies you can pick up and which bunnies they are, while still escaping through the bulkhead before the doors close for good. If there are multiple sets of bunnies of the same size, return the set of bunnies with the lowest prisoner IDs (as indexes) in sorted order. The bunnies are represented as a sorted list by prisoner ID, with the first bunny being 0. There are at most 5 bunnies, and time_limit is a non-negative integer that is at most 999.
For instance, in the case of
[
  [0, 2, 2, 2, -1],  # 0 = Start
  [9, 0, 2, 2, -1],  # 1 = Bunny 0
  [9, 3, 0, 2, -1],  # 2 = Bunny 1
  [9, 3, 2, 0, -1],  # 3 = Bunny 2
  [9, 3, 2, 2,  0],  # 4 = Bulkhead
]
and a time limit of 1, the five inner array rows designate the starting point, bunny 0, bunny 1, bunny 2, and the bulkhead door exit respectively. You could take the path:
Start End Delta Time Status
    -   0     -    1 Bulkhead initially open
    0   4    -1    2
    4   2     2    0
    2   4    -1    1
    4   3     2   -1 Bulkhead closes
    3   4    -1    0 Bulkhead reopens; you and the bunnies exit
With this solution, you would pick up bunnies 1 and 2. This is the best combination for this space station hallway, so the answer is [1, 2]."

pitiful fish#4619,thats 1/9(1/2)(-1)(1)

flat fish#8597,it was yesterday
pitiful fish#4619,look at post
flat fish#8597,yaewo
flat fish#8597,i'm looking through wordly wise book 8
flat fish#8597,"do you prefer concise, amiss, congenial, or abject"
flat fish#8597,lackadaisical
pitiful fish#4619,lexicon
flat fish#8597,slovenly
pitiful fish#4619,peregrinate
pitiful fish#4619,peregrine falcon
flat fish#8597,cursory
flat fish#8597,i'll do toward the hamburger and salad
flat fish#8597,i love when i am learning and my head becomes better
flat fish#8597,#include is basically c++'s import in case you didn't figure that out
flat fish#8597,probably
pitiful fish#4619,so is it that for every c program i need the #include <stdio.h>
pitiful fish#4619,because otherwise i would have no functions?
pitiful fish#4619,does
pitiful fish#4619,for example
pitiful fish#4619,python
pitiful fish#4619,"have a ""basic"" library that stores some basic commands?"
flat fish#8597,in c
flat fish#8597,i think without header files
flat fish#8597,well
flat fish#8597,no see
flat fish#8597,stdio
flat fish#8597,means
flat fish#8597,standard input ooutpitu
flat fish#8597,yeah so that library is for inputs and outputs
flat fish#8597,if you don't have that you can use
flat fish#8597,ints and floats and longs and voids to make variables
flat fish#8597,uhhhhh
flat fish#8597,you can make your own functions i mean
flat fish#8597,yeah
flat fish#8597,yeah without header files i'm pretty sure all you get are the keywords
flat fish#8597,like the variable declarations
flat fish#8597,and if
flat fish#8597,else
flat fish#8597,while
flat fish#8597,for
flat fish#8597,c family languages need semi colons after every line which might be annoying if you're coming from python but yeah then you can just do everything in one line like that which is sometimes actually nicer
flat fish#8597,but i think with python you can also somehow write everything in one line
flat fish#8597,no
flat fish#8597,but uh
flat fish#8597,yeah it's similar
flat fish#8597,java is really similar
flat fish#8597,yeah python looks really really clean
flat fish#8597,it does'nt have the curly braaces either
flat fish#8597,uh
flat fish#8597,so basically
flat fish#8597,in c
flat fish#8597,the int main
flat fish#8597,function is the function called by c
flat fish#8597,yeah
flat fish#8597,python is interpreted language
flat fish#8597,honestly i think the curly braces and semi-colons make the code more flexible and beautiful
flat fish#8597,"has he said ""arcane"" or ""cryptic"" yet"
flat fish#8597,yeah lol
flat fish#8597,i've watched a lecture from a previous year
flat fish#8597,it's the same material
flat fish#8597,what
flat fish#8597,yeah
flat fish#8597,beginning did
flat fish#8597,she started flying
flat fish#8597,with fish
flat fish#8597,no it turned my brain inside out
flat fish#8597,what what means
flat fish#8597,yeah
flat fish#8597,yeah
flat fish#8597,bunny girl senpai actually raised my expectations so high though
flat fish#8597,well
flat fish#8597,bunny girl senpai gives you a lot more time with the characters
flat fish#8597,yeah
flat fish#8597,so i'm saying it's not fiar
flat fish#8597,to compare it like that
flat fish#8597,idk why i hate reading comic books
flat fish#8597,??
flat fish#8597,what
flat fish#8597,uh
flat fish#8597,brb
flat fish#8597,oh
flat fish#8597,hey deafen hey deafen guy guy guy guy guy
flat fish#8597,dude
flat fish#8597,learn the method
flat fish#8597,that i told you about
flat fish#8597,for the problems
flat fish#8597,i sent you
flat fish#8597,it's actually really really clean
flat fish#8597,the MISSISSIPPI problem
flat fish#8597,and cats and dogs
flat fish#8597,電気を消すと暗くなる。
flat fish#8597,why does the なる not need に before it
pitiful fish#4619,u r skipping around
pitiful fish#4619,"because kunakunaru is ""to become dark"""
pitiful fish#4619,"""ni"" either uses the verb stem of a verb or a noun"
pitiful fish#4619,"because the verb stem is technically a noun
and in this case ""kunaku"" is an adverb describing ""naru"""
pitiful fish#4619,u skipped 8 chapters though
pitiful fish#4619,why
flat fish#8597,wdym
flat fish#8597,ok i forgot
flat fish#8597,that you didn't need ni for adverbs
pitiful fish#4619,no
pitiful fish#4619,thats not necessarily true
flat fish#8597,ok
pitiful fish#4619,when u turn a na adj into an adverb u replace na with ni
pitiful fish#4619,because techhnically the the na adj without a na is a noun
flat fish#8597,yeah i know
flat fish#8597,"hey if someone asks ""why is x"" but x is not, then what can you answer other than just saying ""x is not"""
flat fish#8597,so for example
flat fish#8597,if someone asks
flat fish#8597,why did you eat the last cookie
flat fish#8597,but you did not eat the last cookie
flat fish#8597,"is there a way to answer truthfully without saying ""i did not eat the cookie:"
flat fish#8597,no
flat fish#8597,i've wondered this for months
pitiful fish#4619,why is it that you ate the cookie = why did you eat the cookie
pitiful fish#4619,(the fact) that you ate the cookie  = x
pitiful fish#4619,(the fact) that you did not eat the cookie = ~x
flat fish#8597,i meant
flat fish#8597,uh
flat fish#8597,idk how to describe it
flat fish#8597,do you get what i was asking
flat fish#8597,yeah
flat fish#8597,so
flat fish#8597,how do you answer
flat fish#8597,a wrong question
pitiful fish#4619,"""why did you do this?"" ""but i didn't do this"""
flat fish#8597,that isn't what i want though
flat fish#8597,"because if you're in an argument i feel like whenever you just say ""no i'm not"" you just gave a free point to the opponent"
flat fish#8597,idk maybe it's just me
flat fish#8597,as a comeback though
flat fish#8597,not an argument
flat fish#8597,like
flat fish#8597,just
flat fish#8597,if you're fighitng
flat fish#8597,and they call you fat
flat fish#8597,"if you jsut say ""no"""
flat fish#8597,it's kind of not the best response
flat fish#8597,or the coolest response
flat fish#8597,you know
flat fish#8597,no that's just an example
flat fish#8597,because given the situation i can try to say something back
flat fish#8597,"but if they just ask ""why are you fat"""
flat fish#8597,"i mean if there's nothing more you can say than ""no i'm not"" like unless you keep a really cool composition while doing it it's kind of just"
flat fish#8597,so i would always try to answer with something more clever
flat fish#8597,my person i argue with austin is the thing
flat fish#8597,we don't call each other fat like that but we say other dumb things to each other
flat fish#8597,no we flame each other a lot lol
flat fish#8597,no but if he just calls me fat it's not
flat fish#8597,ok
flat fish#8597,well i have to go
flat fish#8597,but
flat fish#8597,we call each other dumb a lot lol
flat fish#8597,in interesting ways
flat fish#8597,but me arguing with austin isn't even why i'm asking that question of how to answer a wrong why question
flat fish#8597,i just want a way that continues the dialogue which no person speaking normal english would use but someone using english to speak logic would use

pitiful fish#4619,but you are skipping
pitiful fish#4619,go back and read it carefully
flat fish#8597,i asked that
flat fish#8597,when i was reading it
flat fish#8597,four times over
pitiful fish#4619,no but
flat fish#8597,it explains its function in one sentence
pitiful fish#4619,how did u get from 3.11 to 4.8
pitiful fish#4619,if u read it logically it makes more sense
flat fish#8597,guy i'm not skipping anything
pitiful fish#4619,but you reading too fast
pitiful fish#4619,slow down
pitiful fish#4619,pay attention
pitiful fish#4619,memorize
flat fish#8597,IT'S NET AO MAESROIZEING
flat fish#8597,it was the first time they mention it
flat fish#8597,and i'm reading that sentence
flat fish#8597,5 times
pitiful fish#4619,if i asked u anything about chapter 4 would u be able to answer
pitiful fish#4619,up to where u are
flat fish#8597,probably
flat fish#8597,unless it's about vocab
pitiful fish#4619,これは何と⾔いましたか

pitiful fish#4619,bring and take
pitiful fish#4619,what is the difference in japanese
flat fish#8597,hwwhat
pitiful fish#4619,conjugate 思う to the a) potential form b) te-form
pitiful fish#4619,"what is the difference between ""to bring"" and ""to take"" in japanese"
flat fish#8597,a) 思える b) 思って
pitiful fish#4619,conjugate する and くる
pitiful fish#4619,potential form
pitiful fish#4619,"a) how do i say that ""i am doing x in/at y""?"" b) when i say -にする what does that mean?"
flat fish#8597,a) ｙにｘ b) do towards; decide on
flat fish#8597,i think i have to go slower on conditionals to memorize the conjugations though
pitiful fish#4619,a) incorrect
pitiful fish#4619,usually you would probably use で and not に
pitiful fish#4619,"""ni"" implies ""towards"" like question b)"
pitiful fish#4619,"but so does ""e"""
pitiful fish#4619,"however ""e"" has a literal ""towards"" meaning - like ""I am going *towards* the school"""
pitiful fish#4619,"then, ""I go to school""  - gakko ni iku"
pitiful fish#4619,"then, ""I do something *at* school"" is then ""gakko de (whatever it is that you do)"""
pitiful fish#4619,"exception is when the action is a ""existing"" action"
pitiful fish#4619,"like ""to exist"""
pitiful fish#4619,"or ""to sit"""
pitiful fish#4619,etc.
pitiful fish#4619,"then you would use ""ni"""
flat fish#8597,isn't で the particle that answers an implied question
flat fish#8597,so the implied quesiton is just where was x done
pitiful fish#4619,uh
pitiful fish#4619,no
pitiful fish#4619,dude
pitiful fish#4619,が particle????
pitiful fish#4619,read it slower duode

pitiful fish#4619,it explains later
pitiful fish#4619,"did u really not learn about ""de"" as locational particle?"
flat fish#8597,not yet i think
flat fish#8597,i see its location usage on jisho when i search sentences for the kanji sometimes
pitiful fish#4619,皆で
pitiful fish#4619,"""with everyone"""

pitiful fish#4619,"""using everyone"""
pitiful fish#4619,wait wait no
pitiful fish#4619,i cant read

pitiful fish#4619,like
flat fish#8597,i c
pitiful fish#4619,"#
  ##"
pitiful fish#4619,it doesnt work is discrod
pitiful fish#4619,but
flat fish#8597,what
flat fish#8597,main is usually an adjective but in video games it can be a verb or a noun
pitiful fish#4619,yes
flat fish#8597,n is congruent to n^3 mod 6
pitiful fish#4619,2
flat fish#8597,i feel like i've told you that but i think i get reminded of that every time i do 2018 amc 10b
flat fish#8597,no i meant
flat fish#8597,n is always congruent to n^3 mod 6
pitiful fish#4619,really
pitiful fish#4619,how prove
flat fish#8597,"try 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5"
pitiful fish#4619,yeah
flat fish#8597,but idk why
flat fish#8597,yeah
pitiful fish#4619,but will n^3 always be 6x + n
pitiful fish#4619,how can u show that
flat fish#8597,yes just take mod 6
flat fish#8597,"ok so we know 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 all work"
pitiful fish#4619,oh
pitiful fish#4619,yeah
pitiful fish#4619,i see
flat fish#8597,⽇本⼈はお酒に弱いというのは本当
flat fish#8597,is the の after the という explanatory or possessive
pitiful fish#4619,what u think
flat fish#8597,epxlanator
pitiful fish#4619,if it was possessive what would the sentence mean
flat fish#8597,japanese people are weak to alcohol type is real
flat fish#8597,i guess
pitiful fish#4619,does that make any sense
flat fish#8597,no
pitiful fish#4619,"the ""thing"" that is the japanese people being weak to alcohol"
pitiful fish#4619,???
flat fish#8597,i guess
flat fish#8597,yea
flat fish#8597,no
flat fish#8597,i might be ashe main
flat fish#8597,maybe it's just a phase
pitiful fish#4619,I didn't find my main until like 6 seasons in
pitiful fish#4619,that's a whole year
pitiful fish#4619,and right now I main a character that wasn't even released when I started playing
flat fish#8597,btw steve is a pianist
flat fish#8597,why's everyone silent
flat fish#8597,ok so like for the が particle whenever it's used in the textbook i'm not sure if it was supposed to point out the subject or if it was needed to be there
flat fish#8597,like
pitiful fish#4619,they dont direct translate after like the start of chapter 4
flat fish#8597,did they just choose to use が there or was it necessary for a reason
pitiful fish#4619,thats for u to figure out
pitiful fish#4619,what if wa was used there
flat fish#8597,ok but
flat fish#8597,aa
flat fish#8597,a;afa
flat fish#8597,lp11?!
flat fish#8597,guy
pitiful fish#4619,what if the subject part was taken out
flat fish#8597,ok
pitiful fish#4619,is it even necessary?
flat fish#8597,true
pitiful fish#4619,so then what does ga bring to the table to make it necessary?
flat fish#8597,i see
pitiful fish#4619,"if u want to specify ""yes, *I* am the one who gave my friend the present"""
pitiful fish#4619,then u need to use ga
pitiful fish#4619,see?
flat fish#8597,so also then that means sometimes they'll just use が because we've already learned it so they just use it
pitiful fish#4619,because it would make sense under context
pitiful fish#4619,yes
flat fish#8597,ok thakns
flat fish#8597,i mean they still translate literally sometimes
flat fish#8597,do you still do it
flat fish#8597,stephane says night raids are too hard for him
flat fish#8597,i made it to numbers and counting in the textbook
flat fish#8597,i think i forgot half the conjugations but that's probably fine

1. To abstain from beans. 
2. Not to pick up what has fallen. 
3· Not to touch a white cock. 
4· Not to break bread. 
5· Not to step over a crossbar. 
6. Not to stir the fire with iron. 
7· Not to eat from a whole loaf. 
8. Not to pluck a garland. 
9· Not to sit on a quart measure. 
10. Not to eat the heart. 
11. Not to walk on highways. 
12. Not to let swallows share one's roof. 
13. When the pot is taken off the fire, not to leave the mark of it in the ashes, but to stir them together. 
14. Do not look in a mirror beside a light."

pitiful fish#4619,(x+y)p = xp + yp (mod p).
pitiful fish#4619,wait
pitiful fish#4619,(x+y)^p = x^p + y^p mod p
pitiful fish#4619,so the sum of the middle terms are divisible by p?
pitiful fish#4619,(x+y)^4
pitiful fish#4619,x^4 + 4x^3y+ 6x^2y^2 + 4xy^3 + y^4
pitiful fish#4619,4x^3y + 6x^2y^2 + 4xy^3 = 0 (mod 4)
pitiful fish#4619,but why

pitiful fish#4619,bro
flat fish#8597,ok uhh

flat fish#8597,but the binomial theorem tells us
flat fish#8597,"the middle terms are C(p, k) {0 < k < p}"
flat fish#8597,multiplied by x^k * y^(p-k)
pitiful fish#4619,yeah
pitiful fish#4619,how i got 1 4 6 4 1
flat fish#8597,"we also know the sum of all C(p, k) {0 ≤ k ≤ p} is 2^p"
pitiful fish#4619,ok
pitiful fish#4619,so

pitiful fish#4619,can u help
pitiful fish#4619,how u prove log_a(x) = log_a^n(x^n)
pitiful fish#4619,
pitiful fish#4619,how
flat fish#8597,well first of all
flat fish#8597,does it make sense
pitiful fish#4619,yeah
pitiful fish#4619,if u convert it to exponential it makes perfect sense
flat fish#8597,ok then
pitiful fish#4619,halp
flat fish#8597,well
flat fish#8597,do you like logarithms
flat fish#8597,are they fun
pitiful fish#4619,no
flat fish#8597,and cool
flat fish#8597,ok
flat fish#8597,so if you don't want logarithms
flat fish#8597,get rid of them
pitiful fish#4619,so
pitiful fish#4619,do u convert to exponential form?
pitiful fish#4619,i mean i did that and it worked
pitiful fish#4619,but i dont think thats how our teacher wanted us to do it
flat fish#8597,what
flat fish#8597,why not
pitiful fish#4619,idk
pitiful fish#4619,we learnign propoerties of logs
pitiful fish#4619,so we probably have to use them???
pitiful fish#4619,idk
flat fish#8597,that is a property of logarithsm tho
flat fish#8597,what
flat fish#8597,they are exponents
pitiful fish#4619,okok
pitiful fish#4619,at least try it yourself
pitiful fish#4619,converting to exponential
pitiful fish#4619,check if it works
flat fish#8597,wait
flat fish#8597,i just got it
flat fish#8597,ok
flat fish#8597,don't

 - two primes
 - a prime and a semiprime (a semiprime is the product of two primes)"

flat fish#8597,how was it
pitiful fish#4619,harder than past years
flat fish#8597,i thought it was easier than last tyear's but maybe becuase i've gotten better
flat fish#8597,dude i spent like 12 min doing nothing
flat fish#8597,because i jumped from problem to problem
flat fish#8597,not good
pitiful fish#4619,how many did u complete
flat fish#8597,16
flat fish#8597,so max score is 109.5
flat fish#8597,last year's floors were 103.5 and 102
flat fish#8597,so if i can get 1 wrong and maybe meet aime
flat fish#8597,what about you
pitiful fish#4619,i did like 10
pitiful fish#4619,bad
pitiful fish#4619,very bad
flat fish#8597,uh oh
pitiful fish#4619,i got used to working slow
flat fish#8597,this is what i've been todl
flat fish#8597,you must get all 1 to 15 right or else making aime will be very difficult
flat fish#8597,1 through 10 are pretty free but try to finish first 15 in 35-45 min
flat fish#8597,"""I has a period of 1."" is a sentence"
pitiful fish#4619,i is singular but it uses have
pitiful fish#4619,you is plural and it uses have
pitiful fish#4619,he is singular and it uses has
flat fish#8597,I refers to the identity element of groups
pitiful fish#4619,still
pitiful fish#4619,why is I a plural noun with the verb to have
pitiful fish#4619,why is I a plural noun in generak
flat fish#8597,it's not the plural nouns that use have
flat fish#8597,i mean
flat fish#8597,it's not the plural nouns specifically
flat fish#8597,it's also the first person singular
flat fish#8597,like in french
pitiful fish#4619,ai is not ont
flat fish#8597,well it's not french
flat fish#8597,just imagine
flat fish#8597,have
flat fish#8597,is different from have
flat fish#8597,but they look the same
pitiful fish#4619,no
pitiful fish#4619,have as a helping verb
pitiful fish#4619,conjugation wise
pitiful fish#4619,should be the same as the verb to have
pitiful fish#4619,
pitiful fish#4619,how
pitiful fish#4619,OH

flat fish#8597,unlucky
flat fish#8597,imgaine if you misclick on amc
flat fish#8597,would be really not fun
pitiful fish#4619,is it worth it for me to take an official amc course
pitiful fish#4619,because my tutor rn is not very good at amc
pitiful fish#4619,so i dont get to learn very much
flat fish#8597,aops is really op
flat fish#8597,it's pay to win
flat fish#8597,if you actually do the course
pitiful fish#4619,how mcuh is it
flat fish#8597,idk
pitiful fish#4619,im considering doing something like that because im frustrated that i always get a low score for amc
flat fish#8597,few hundred money i think?
flat fish#8597,they're usually like 4 months long though
pitiful fish#4619,and like when i look at the solutions a lot of stuff i havent learned
pitiful fish#4619,like vieta formula
pitiful fish#4619,or euclidean algorithim
pitiful fish#4619,or whatever
flat fish#8597,yeah
pitiful fish#4619,even modular arithmetic
pitiful fish#4619,i just havent learned that kinda stuff so its hard for me to do well
flat fish#8597,i would take the individual four math subjects' courses
flat fish#8597,but if you want you can just take the amc 10
flat fish#8597,course
pitiful fish#4619,hey

flat fish#8597,parle a ta tete
flat fish#8597,i really don't like how they teach c
flat fish#8597,that's like teaching your french with the racist old french textbooks
flat fish#8597,except it's not offensive
flat fish#8597,no it's like
flat fish#8597,c is not modern at all
flat fish#8597,ii think
flat fish#8597,people still use it
flat fish#8597,but if you
flat fish#8597,aa
flat fish#8597,idk but
flat fish#8597,dude
flat fish#8597,they're not even teaching straight c
flat fish#8597,they made their own header
flat fish#8597,nobody uses <cs50> in real life
flat fish#8597,nobody uses get_string
flat fish#8597,they use scanf

flat fish#8597,you should
flat fish#8597,there is good at end
flat fish#8597,bogo sort is random order
flat fish#8597,then check
flat fish#8597,then random order
flat fish#8597,then check
flat fish#8597,then random order
flat fish#8597,then check
flat fish#8597,well
flat fish#8597,comments are all memes
flat fish#8597,uhh
flat fish#8597,it's
flat fish#8597,O(massive) time
flat fish#8597,yea
flat fish#8597,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort
flat fish#8597,well
flat fish#8597,if it's good
flat fish#8597,it has limits
flat fish#8597,ajkal
flat fish#8597,fkfkfkf
flat fish#8597,u
flat fish#8597,h
flat fish#8597,wait
flat fish#8597,this thing is so smart
flat fish#8597,uh limits
flat fish#8597,it's
flat fish#8597,only for
flat fish#8597,lexicographic things
flat fish#8597,so like
flat fish#8597,everything basically
flat fish#8597,so how it works
flat fish#8597,is
flat fish#8597,ok let's say we're sorting numbers
pitiful fish#4619,ok jongy
pitiful fish#4619,lets say were sorting numbers
flat fish#8597,wait a minute
flat fish#8597,OK YES
flat fish#8597,so
pitiful fish#4619,so
flat fish#8597,you look at the first digit
pitiful fish#4619,right
flat fish#8597,of every number
flat fish#8597,but
flat fish#8597,like
flat fish#8597,first digit
flat fish#8597,also can be 0
flat fish#8597,so depends on longest number
pitiful fish#4619,12345678765423456786345678
flat fish#8597,well
flat fish#8597,it still works
flat fish#8597,yeah so you would look at 8
flat fish#8597,and 8 is put into the 0 bucket
flat fish#8597,yeah
flat fish#8597,uh
flat fish#8597,yeah
flat fish#8597,but
flat fish#8597,numebrs
flat fish#8597,P) ))))
flat fish#8597,so then
flat fish#8597,you go into each bucket
flat fish#8597,and look at second digit
flat fish#8597,but second digit can be 0
flat fish#8597,and
flat fish#8597,yea
flat fish#8597,it's recursive
pitiful fish#4619,452637423743753454986704857-450687068-5096835-6098345-6098436-09468-0943568-08960-439864068458769485762485976429786249872456984576234978532458734659857692387524
flat fish#8597,yeah that would be kind of inefficient use i think if you also had one digit numbers
flat fish#8597,because the one digit numbers would use a lot of time doing nothign
flat fish#8597,ya!
flat fish#8597,help my smell like eggs

flat fish#8597,月 radical means body but then when you combine it with the word body 生 and get 胜 it means win
pitiful fish#4619,comes from meat
pitiful fish#4619,also because
pitiful fish#4619,i think
pitiful fish#4619,like
pitiful fish#4619,the chinese associated body parts with different thing
pitiful fish#4619,
pitiful fish#4619,for example
pitiful fish#4619,"""ni mei you dan zi"""
pitiful fish#4619,"literally ""you dont have a gallbladder"""
pitiful fish#4619,"but it means ""youre cowardly*"""
pitiful fish#4619,etc.
flat fish#8597,wait maybe what i typed didn't make immediate sense to you because the traditional chinese is different i think

flat fish#8597,:))
pitiful fish#4619,WOAH
pitiful fish#4619,WHOA
pitiful fish#4619,AOHW
flat fish#8597,:                                         hey
pitiful fish#4619,hey
pitiful fish#4619,wahts happenign
flat fish#8597,they are 5 stacking for fun
flat fish#8597,no sweaty tryhard
pitiful fish#4619,i dont think they know how to have fun
pitiful fish#4619,they are playing valorant
flat fish#8597,bro
flat fish#8597,i don't get it
flat fish#8597,like
flat fish#8597,they're having fun
flat fish#8597,why do you guys say valorant is bad
flat fish#8597,it's doing its job
pitiful fish#4619,whos us guys
flat fish#8597,they're having fun
flat fish#8597,you kai arda
pitiful fish#4619,ok i was joking but
flat fish#8597,no but
flat fish#8597,normally
pitiful fish#4619,do u actually want my take?
flat fish#8597,ok
pitiful fish#4619,u know that i kinda quite ow and played a bunch of tarkov
pitiful fish#4619,like 300 hrs of it
pitiful fish#4619,the thing about tarkov is like
pitiful fish#4619,yeah
pitiful fish#4619,"""oh my god i died again"""
pitiful fish#4619,"""bro this game is so bad"""
pitiful fish#4619,but i only died because of my own mistakes
pitiful fish#4619,i died because of me
pitiful fish#4619,ok
pitiful fish#4619,and the game is also really versatile
pitiful fish#4619,theres literally infinite maps if u take into account every part of the maps
pitiful fish#4619,like idek all the maps ye
pitiful fish#4619,and i have 300 hrs
pitiful fish#4619,the most important thing though
pitiful fish#4619,i realized that playing a team based game with them specifically
pitiful fish#4619,is just not fun at all
pitiful fish#4619,its not enjoyable
pitiful fish#4619,they care too much
pitiful fish#4619,id already given up the mentality of sr before anything in ow before
pitiful fish#4619,but the thing is tarkov is a positive sum game
pitiful fish#4619,"as long as u play, u will start to make money"
pitiful fish#4619,"its like the devs managed to completely remove the concept of ""lose"""
pitiful fish#4619,granted u still lose gear etc
pitiful fish#4619,but its just a lot more fun to not have to risk the something like sr that the they just care so much about
pitiful fish#4619,so then i started playing other games with other people
pitiful fish#4619,like the people in greene
pitiful fish#4619,like u guys
pitiful fish#4619,for league of legends
pitiful fish#4619,i take the game seriously
pitiful fish#4619,but in a learning way
pitiful fish#4619,not in a way as them
pitiful fish#4619,and if u see me playing ow or r6 now
pitiful fish#4619,its very casual
flat fish#8597,i see that
pitiful fish#4619,even if im playing ranked games
flat fish#8597,so is it valorant
flat fish#8597,or their mentality
pitiful fish#4619,the thing is
pitiful fish#4619,them playing valorant exacerbates it
pitiful fish#4619,look
pitiful fish#4619,first of all
pitiful fish#4619,playing with kai is no fun at all
pitiful fish#4619,unless youre playing like cs or r6
pitiful fish#4619,playing valorant with him is absolute ass
pitiful fish#4619,and then
pitiful fish#4619,theres the mentality of playing the game for fun
pitiful fish#4619,why do i sometimes ask to play valorant?
pitiful fish#4619,ik im not going to do well
pitiful fish#4619,but im just trying to hang out w some friends*
pitiful fish#4619,thats kinda why i play with the greene kids more
pitiful fish#4619,they are there to play with friends
pitiful fish#4619,not to necessarily be better at the game
pitiful fish#4619,at least
pitiful fish#4619,the kids in the greene server have their priorities straight
pitiful fish#4619,relationships before rating
pitiful fish#4619,saucy would function much better in an environment without someone like tyler or kai
pitiful fish#4619,he just doesnt know that because hes been with tyler for his whole gaming career
pitiful fish#4619,so really
pitiful fish#4619,what i should have said instead
flat fish#8597,gaming
pitiful fish#4619,would be something like
pitiful fish#4619,"""they dont know how to have fun when theyre in that group"""
pitiful fish#4619,i would play valorant in a heartbeat if it were with the greene kids or with u guys in walmart or with allan
pitiful fish#4619,even if it were ranked
pitiful fish#4619,idk man this group is weird
flat fish#8597,who is allan btw
pitiful fish#4619,and there is the final issue of ryan and tyler
flat fish#8597,bc455 or something right
pitiful fish#4619,but thats even mroe complicated
pitiful fish#4619,yes
flat fish#8597,where is he from
pitiful fish#4619,goes to paly
pitiful fish#4619,in like 3 of my classes
flat fish#8597,is he new person yo met
pitiful fish#4619,yeah
flat fish#8597,wait was he the new tarkov guy
pitiful fish#4619,what no
pitiful fish#4619,new?
pitiful fish#4619,bruh
flat fish#8597,idk
flat fish#8597,like
flat fish#8597,you found him
flat fish#8597,so he's new
pitiful fish#4619,sure
flat fish#8597,to you
flat fish#8597,ok well
flat fish#8597,yea
flat fish#8597,kinda sucks
pitiful fish#4619,valorant is just a game
flat fish#8597,idk when i play with them they're just smurfing so it's pretty fun
pitiful fish#4619,not good
pitiful fish#4619,not bad
pitiful fish#4619,just like any other game
flat fish#8597,yeah but i don't understand like kai and arda
pitiful fish#4619,alright
flat fish#8597,maybe they're joking
pitiful fish#4619,im going to now retract what i said
pitiful fish#4619,valorant leans toward the bad side of competitive shooters
pitiful fish#4619,because we are cs go players
pitiful fish#4619,and r6
pitiful fish#4619,and ow
pitiful fish#4619,these games are (were once) all better than valorant
pitiful fish#4619,valorant has never been a good game
pitiful fish#4619,so to spea
pitiful fish#4619,k
pitiful fish#4619,u dont play cs go for some reason
pitiful fish#4619,but if u do youll see that its objectively better than valorant
pitiful fish#4619,u play ow but not seriously
pitiful fish#4619,probably because the game is half dead anyways
pitiful fish#4619,whatever
pitiful fish#4619,you have never played r6 but it is a really good game
pitiful fish#4619,its kinda broken rn but its really fun
pitiful fish#4619,like leaning
pitiful fish#4619,ropelling
pitiful fish#4619,quick peeking
pitiful fish#4619,util
pitiful fish#4619,maps
pitiful fish#4619,in general r6 is much more leaning-casual-player friendly
pitiful fish#4619,ok got it?
flat fish#8597,yep
flat fish#8597,but they still play valorant which is like ok i guess searching for depression is fine i mean i play league
pitiful fish#4619,u know why
pitiful fish#4619,they reject the greene kids
pitiful fish#4619,they reject the allan crowd
pitiful fish#4619,so all they have is the people in mccuck
pitiful fish#4619,and since they only play valorant
pitiful fish#4619,well
flat fish#8597,m
pitiful fish#4619,and the thing is
flat fish#8597,sad
pitiful fish#4619,im sure kai and arda dont even like tyler etc. as people in general
pitiful fish#4619,but theyve just been with each other for so long
pitiful fish#4619,i personally dont get their issue with the greene kids
pitiful fish#4619,i think its kind of a kai -> arda and arda -> kai loop thing that they cant escape
pitiful fish#4619,but they cant see that the greene kids
pitiful fish#4619,albeit slightly weirder
pitiful fish#4619,are still people
pitiful fish#4619,whatever
pitiful fish#4619,it isnt my business to get into why people dont like other people
pitiful fish#4619,im just gonna do what i do
pitiful fish#4619,ok got it?
flat fish#8597,yipee
pitiful fish#4619,play more shooters
pitiful fish#4619,starting with valorant is bad
pitiful fish#4619,valorant isnt good
pitiful fish#4619,yk how i complain about icebox right
pitiful fish#4619,because the map sucks so much
flat fish#8597,everyone complains
flat fish#8597,about that
pitiful fish#4619,go on any cs go map and youll see
pitiful fish#4619,ok but why dont u complaing
flat fish#8597,wh
pitiful fish#4619,actually play other shooters
pitiful fish#4619,then come back and tell me valorant is a good game
pitiful fish#4619,oh and btw
pitiful fish#4619,i dont think that group has ever had as much fun playing valorant as playing ow
flat fish#8597,why don't they
flat fish#8597,do you think
pitiful fish#4619,just a guess
pitiful fish#4619,i dont spend a lot of time with them so i wouldnt know but
flat fish#8597,i mena
flat fish#8597,wehy don't they play overwatch
flat fish#8597,do you guess
pitiful fish#4619,burnout
pitiful fish#4619,weve been playing the game for 3 and a half years
pitiful fish#4619,tyler is hardstuck
pitiful fish#4619,trash player
pitiful fish#4619,saucy gets competitive stress
pitiful fish#4619,and i flamed him a lot so he probably has like trauma or something
flat fish#8597,trauma
pitiful fish#4619,also not a very good player
flat fish#8597,pretty bad
flat fish#8597,really?
flat fish#8597,i thought he was good
flat fish#8597,you even ask him things
pitiful fish#4619,yeah hes like low diamond
pitiful fish#4619,which is alright
pitiful fish#4619,yeaah because i dont play sup
pitiful fish#4619,im tank main
pitiful fish#4619,remember
flat fish#8597,enk
pitiful fish#4619,but fr
pitiful fish#4619,ow does get unfun after a while
pitiful fish#4619,im hoping that they can have that revelation for valorant before too long
pitiful fish#4619,for me
pitiful fish#4619,like 1-2 games of valorant is enough for like 2-3 weeks
pitiful fish#4619,its just the same thing over and over
flat fish#8597,ai
pitiful fish#4619,at least im good enough at ow so that i can kinda troll and still not throw games
pitiful fish#4619,so i can have fun
flat fish#8597,iron is probably more interesting than gold
flat fish#8597,if you bring that up
pitiful fish#4619,but they care about rank
pitiful fish#4619,see
flat fish#8597,i have fun playing valoran still
flat fish#8597,maybe until i climb to
flat fish#8597,silver
pitiful fish#4619,yeah because u take it like the way u take ow
pitiful fish#4619,right?
flat fish#8597,mm true
pitiful fish#4619,u probably have a diff mindset when u play league then when u play valorant
pitiful fish#4619,right?
flat fish#8597,esp now i'm actually looking for iron moments
flat fish#8597,uh
flat fish#8597,idk
flat fish#8597,i ahven't play ranked league
flat fish#8597,in months
pitiful fish#4619,oh
pitiful fish#4619,ok
flat fish#8597,i think so
flat fish#8597,ranked league
flat fish#8597,is
flat fish#8597,so cancer dude
pitiful fish#4619,do u tilt from playing a lot of valorant
flat fish#8597,mm
flat fish#8597,maybe
flat fish#8597,if i'm top frag
flat fish#8597,because that means the rest of my tema
flat fish#8597,is
pitiful fish#4619,but def less than league right?
flat fish#8597,yea
pitiful fish#4619,right
pitiful fish#4619,exactly
pitiful fish#4619,i dont think ive unironically tilted in several weeks
flat fish#8597,my main game is mineplex suber smash mobs

pitiful fish#4619,u should come
flat fish#8597,i know 3 people in my class
flat fish#8597,wait if i rotates by 90
flat fish#8597,isn't the square root of i just
flat fish#8597,cos 45deg + sin 45deg i
pitiful fish#4619,uh
pitiful fish#4619,yeah
pitiful fish#4619,sqrt(2)/2+ sqrt(2)i/2
pitiful fish#4619,u can think of it as applying cis(theta) twice to get a number
flat fish#8597,today i realized i can use the fact that i rotates by 90 deg to easily remember the i power cycle
pitiful fish#4619,which just rotates by theta twice
pitiful fish#4619,so can u find the cube roots of -1
pitiful fish#4619,i think theres 3
flat fish#8597,yeah so i can just remember ok rotate 90 i rotate 90 -1 rotate 90 -i rotate 90 1
flat fish#8597,instead of
flat fish#8597,what is i^ 3
flat fish#8597,"i^2 = -1, so i^3 = -i"
pitiful fish#4619,find cube root of -1
pitiful fish#4619,dekribr
pitiful fish#4619,go
pitiful fish#4619,using cis
flat fish#8597,go

pitiful fish#4619,come on man
pitiful fish#4619,use radians
flat fish#8597,true
flat fish#8597,we are grown ups now : )

flat fish#8597,like dude when your cypher main setup nobody knows about actually works you are feeling fantastic
flat fish#8597,yeah but
flat fish#8597,i can't
flat fish#8597,do that
flat fish#8597,)
flat fish#8597,but i mean
flat fish#8597,i like cypher anyway
flat fish#8597,fire players on
flat fish#8597,only they
flat fish#8597,my first grade teacher told us to answer questions in a way such that someone could tell what the original question was
flat fish#8597,i might get glasses or need glasses soon soon soon in some time
flat fish#8597,my left eye sees a little less clearly than my right eye now
flat fish#8597,yeah applies to league too
flat fish#8597,yeah i do that
pitiful fish#4619,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.H.O.O.Q

pitiful fish#4619,what class is this from
flat fish#8597,analysis
pitiful fish#4619,yellow man butt is the olden ratio
flat fish#8597,yo
flat fish#8597,matrices done
flat fish#8597,we are
flat fish#8597,starting
flat fish#8597,calculus stuff after break
flat fish#8597,but first are sequences and series
pitiful fish#4619,lim h --> infinity (f(x+h)-f(x))/h
flat fish#8597,
flat fish#8597,she has to check
flat fish#8597,she doesn't know
flat fish#8597,yeah
flat fish#8597,lim h --> infinity (f(x+h)-f(x))/h
pitiful fish#4619,do u know exp(x) is the taylor expansion for e^x
flat fish#8597,no
pitiful fish#4619,exp(x) is a polynomial
pitiful fish#4619,e^x is exponential
pitiful fish#4619,since e^x is its own derivative it follows that e^it is equal to i * e^it
pitiful fish#4619,"since multiplying by i gives a rotation of 90 degrees on the imaginary plane, we can imagine that there is a position vector (e^it) as well as a velocity vector (i * e^it)"
pitiful fish#4619,this velocity vector will be perpendicular to the position vector
pitiful fish#4619,"plugging in 0 for t, we get that e^it = 1"
pitiful fish#4619,"our velocity vector is effectively that same vector, just going up one unit from 1"
pitiful fish#4619,"if we follow the velocity vector and trace out the position vector, we can clearly see that there is a circle"

flat fish#8597,so does
flat fish#8597,hey
flat fish#8597,hey
pitiful fish#4619,but its three words
pitiful fish#4619,imagine u sent this
pitiful fish#4619,"Never, EVER put diet coke and mentos in your ass
Y’all know about the prostate gland? The male rub-to-cum? Yea that thing. This is the glorious story of how I tried (and failed) to stimulate it.
The Buildup
I was drinking Pepsi and reading an article on how prostate stimulation intensifies orgasms. So, I had the genius idea of using coke to stimulate my ass. WCGW? I mean that the carbonation feels... good in my mouth, so It should work in my ass.
As an engineer, there are many logistical challenges to bypass when trying to insert coke into one’s asshole.
Q: How do I put cola in my anus in the first place?
A: You use the rim of the bottle and stick it directly in the anus.
Q: How do I make sure that the coke stays there?
A: You don’t. That’s where I fucked up
Now, with a half-assed plan, I went to the store. As I was checking out, I saw a pack mentos.
Time to bring this to level two. I put back the original coke and bought diet coke instead. All 2 liters of glory.
The disaster
20 mins later..."
pitiful fish#4619,"With three mentos in my ass, I gingerly lowered the rim to my rim and poured. The reaction was nearly instant. With the tidal force of a tsunami, the bottle was violently ejected from my ass. A pressure was building up, and the gates of hell opened. I felt Satan’s sugary fire burst from my asshole onto the bed. Holy shit, you would not realize the panic I had. There was a pain, both emotional and physical. The sugary wet fart, the sound of a thousand ass-trumpets creating a heavenly cacophony. I saw the light, I saw the dark. I felt The intense sting of carbonation,  I experienced nothing and everything. I had found God, and he was punishing me. There was the maddening sensation of your asshole bending over itself, inside out, shrinking, expanding. It was worse than any experience ever. My brain still cannot comprehend the sensations, but they were torturous. I have contemplated what hell might feel like, and I know that I could find peace there.
My bed was soaked with shit-coke. Lord, how am I to clean up.
Don't ever try what I did.
The aftermath
I learned a very valuable lesson that day. Don’t try anything insane. Avoid the asshole.  Also, TIL that the human asshole can stretch 8 centimeters without damage.
TL;DR: Stick to beating your meat, folks."
pitiful fish#4619,like
flat fish#8597,mm hmm yes
flat fish#8597,imagine i sent that

pitiful fish#4619,if he loses his role hes going to be really mad
pitiful fish#4619,he doesnt have the greatest map awareness
pitiful fish#4619,and if people start flaming him then
pitiful fish#4619,"""/mute all"""
flat fish#8597,i mean i don't have the greatest aim but you support me playing windowmaker
flat fish#8597,yeah /muteall is good
flat fish#8597,everyone should do it
pitiful fish#4619,i support u playing widowmaker
pitiful fish#4619,but that doesnt mean i know youll do well on her
pitiful fish#4619,jongy
pitiful fish#4619,i support u since u dont necessarily take the game seriously
flat fish#8597,wait you do
flat fish#8597,that was a
flat fish#8597,ok
pitiful fish#4619,i mean
pitiful fish#4619,what do i have against it
pitiful fish#4619,but the thing with kai is that he takes all his games too seriously
pitiful fish#4619,like
pitiful fish#4619,i just think that with kai jungling its like
pitiful fish#4619,"ok, later on in the future it might work out"
pitiful fish#4619,but its going to be a long road of pain
pitiful fish#4619,tbh
pitiful fish#4619,anybody can play any role
pitiful fish#4619,but thinking about the immediate future makes me concerned if kai is on jungle
pitiful fish#4619,if u dont agree thats fine
pitiful fish#4619,but i think u should have enough experience on kai as to build up some kind of profile on him
pitiful fish#4619,so you should know what kai would enjoy/not enjoy
pitiful fish#4619,its not really about tilt
pitiful fish#4619,see
pitiful fish#4619,the thing about other games
pitiful fish#4619,i get what youre trying to say when u compare him playing jungle with ow
pitiful fish#4619,or
pitiful fish#4619,valorant
pitiful fish#4619,or
pitiful fish#4619,tarkov
pitiful fish#4619,but im really trying to build this analysis on the basis of what kai is saying while we are playing
pitiful fish#4619,because league is just a different kind of enjoyment than fps
pitiful fish#4619,yes?
pitiful fish#4619,no?
flat fish#8597,wha does that mean
pitiful fish#4619,what does what mean
pitiful fish#4619,ok dude u need to answer if u want me to answer
flat fish#8597,i'm not agreeing or disagreeing because idk what i'm agreeing to
pitiful fish#4619,no
pitiful fish#4619,u misunderstand
pitiful fish#4619,not about agreeing
pitiful fish#4619,or disagreeing
pitiful fish#4619,look
pitiful fish#4619,u said it yourself
pitiful fish#4619,"""jungling is like supporting the whole team"""
pitiful fish#4619,and well
pitiful fish#4619,kai does not like the enabler role
pitiful fish#4619,ok why am i getting so caught up over this
pitiful fish#4619,this is pointless
pitiful fish#4619,kai isnt me
pitiful fish#4619,he can go do one

flat fish#8597,dude read what i wrote
flat fish#8597,this is gonna happen on assessment i wswae
flat fish#8597,i imagine
flat fish#8597,somebody
pitiful fish#4619,same
pitiful fish#4619,uh huh
pitiful fish#4619,mm hm
pitiful fish#4619,yep
pitiful fish#4619,thats right
pitiful fish#4619,yeah
pitiful fish#4619,certainly
pitiful fish#4619,of course
pitiful fish#4619,sure
pitiful fish#4619,yes
flat fish#8597,probably proved the riemann hypothesis
flat fish#8597,100 years ago
flat fish#8597,but messed up last equation
flat fish#8597,and just
pitiful fish#4619,no they pulled a fermat
pitiful fish#4619,"""wow i just found a proof but im just gonna not put it down"""
pitiful fish#4619,stupid little fermat and his last theorem
pitiful fish#4619,stupid
flat fish#8597,stupid!
flat fish#8597,that's right
flat fish#8597,stupid!
pitiful fish#4619,yep
pitiful fish#4619,thats right
pitiful fish#4619,mm hm
pitiful fish#4619,uh huh
pitiful fish#4619,yes
pitiful fish#4619,yeah
pitiful fish#4619,sure
pitiful fish#4619,certainly
pitiful fish#4619,oh yeah
pitiful fish#4619,of course
flat fish#8597,THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING!
pitiful fish#4619,"Dude, I had literally the same idea!"
flat fish#8597,THAT'S WHAT I JUST SAID !!!!!!!!!!
pitiful fish#4619,"Wait, really?"
pitiful fish#4619,Oh shoot!
pitiful fish#4619,I didn't realize!
pitiful fish#4619,Sorry!
pitiful fish#4619,My bad!
pitiful fish#4619,Apologies!
pitiful fish#4619,May I have your forgiveness?
pitiful fish#4619,Will you forgive me?
flat fish#8597,no
pitiful fish#4619,".
│
."
flat fish#8597,i'm sorry
flat fish#8597,for making you sideways
pitiful fish#4619,it is okay.
pitiful fish#4619,i am okay now.
pitiful fish#4619,what does this mean
pitiful fish#4619,This function has the property that the image of each point in the complex plane is equidistant from that point and the origin
pitiful fish#4619,"what is ""image"""
flat fish#8597,the value returned by the function on that point
pitiful fish#4619,huh??
pitiful fish#4619,so like
pitiful fish#4619,f(x)?
flat fish#8597,This function has the property that the result of the function on each point in the complex plane is equidistant from that point and the origin
pitiful fish#4619,so if i plug in
pitiful fish#4619,like
pitiful fish#4619,a + i
pitiful fish#4619,1 + i
flat fish#8597,if that function were f
flat fish#8597,f(1 + i) would be equidistant from 1 + i and 0
pitiful fish#4619,ohhhhh
pitiful fish#4619,i see
pitiful fish#4619,ok
pitiful fish#4619,so it would be like
pitiful fish#4619,Re(f(1 + i)) = 1/2
pitiful fish#4619,or something like that
pitiful fish#4619,right
pitiful fish#4619,so wait
pitiful fish#4619,then
pitiful fish#4619,ok
pitiful fish#4619,ok
pitiful fish#4619,ok
pitiful fish#4619,ok
pitiful fish#4619,ok
flat fish#8597,wwaAAA?waa
flat fish#8597,w??WA?w/sa/?AS??a
pitiful fish#4619,i think i know how to solve prolem
pitiful fish#4619,there
pitiful fish#4619,edited
flat fish#8597,it would be along one line
flat fish#8597,Re(f(x)) + Im(f(x)) = 1
pitiful fish#4619,no
pitiful fish#4619,im just saying for 1 + i specifically
pitiful fish#4619,wait wat
flat fish#8597,yeah
flat fish#8597,so for that
pitiful fish#4619,how do u define complex functions
flat fish#8597,it would be along that ling
pitiful fish#4619,do u have to define real and imaginary part
flat fish#8597,"wdym,"
pitiful fish#4619,or
flat fish#8597,no?
pitiful fish#4619,ok
pitiful fish#4619,ok
pitiful fish#4619,nvm
pitiful fish#4619,Re(f(x)) + Im(f(x)) = 1
pitiful fish#4619,wait how did u get this
flat fish#8597,because
flat fish#8597,it's
flat fish#8597,between
flat fish#8597,0 and 1 + i
flat fish#8597,*equidistant
pitiful fish#4619,no but
pitiful fish#4619,uh
pitiful fish#4619,ok so
flat fish#8597,
pitiful fish#4619,
pitiful fish#4619,yeah
pitiful fish#4619,but how is that Re(f(x)) + Im(f(x)) = 1
flat fish#8597,oh wait not x
flat fish#8597,z
flat fish#8597,z
flat fish#8597,z
flat fish#8597,z
flat fish#8597,z
flat fish#8597,or w
flat fish#8597,complex number
flat fish#8597,ee  aeA EAAee
pitiful fish#4619,ok
flat fish#8597,you notice i didn't label axis :  ) )
pitiful fish#4619,how do u go from equidistant to the formula for the line
pitiful fish#4619,if they are equidistant they will add up to what
pitiful fish#4619,like instead
pitiful fish#4619,if i did
pitiful fish#4619,f(2 + 3i)
flat fish#8597,it's the perpendicular bisector
pitiful fish#4619,ok
pitiful fish#4619,so
pitiful fish#4619,?
pitiful fish#4619,ohh
pitiful fish#4619,no
pitiful fish#4619,ok
pitiful fish#4619,we didnt learn to graph on the complex plane in our class
flat fish#8597,"well i mean it's the same as x,y plane but with Re(z),Im(z)."
pitiful fish#4619,so i can think of
pitiful fish#4619,x as Re(z)
pitiful fish#4619,and y as Im(z)?
pitiful fish#4619,can i express Im(z) as a function of Re(z)
flat fish#8597,those are the corresponding axis i mean
pitiful fish#4619,but thats stupd
flat fish#8597,i mean the imaginary plane isn't meant to be used for graphing
flat fish#8597,anything which would express im(z) as a function of re(z) is probably pretty stupid too
pitiful fish#4619,alright
pitiful fish#4619,wait
pitiful fish#4619,so
pitiful fish#4619,lets say i take f(2 + 3i)
pitiful fish#4619,"first i imagine instead of 2 + 3i its (2, 3)"
pitiful fish#4619,so i find the line equidistant on the cartesian plane
pitiful fish#4619,i get y = -2/3x + 3
pitiful fish#4619,how does that translate to complex plane
pitiful fish#4619,could i say
pitiful fish#4619,like
pitiful fish#4619,2Re(z) + 3Im(z) = 9
pitiful fish#4619,like standard form
pitiful fish#4619,basically
flat fish#8597,what is -2/3x + 3
flat fish#8597,that's not equidisatnat
pitiful fish#4619,yes
pitiful fish#4619,what
pitiful fish#4619,it is
flat fish#8597,tha'ts not the perpendidaalar biesctor
flat fish#8597,idk dude seems pretty not equidistant to me
pitiful fish#4619,
flat fish#8597,oh
flat fish#8597,i 'ma e bea'
pitiful fish#4619,whatever
pitiful fish#4619,so i just multiplied by 3 on both sides
pitiful fish#4619,put it to standard form
pitiful fish#4619,then replace x with Re(z) and y with Im(z)?
flat fish#8597,idk
flat fish#8597,what's the porblem
flat fish#8597,what are you trhieng to fdn
pitiful fish#4619,so
pitiful fish#4619,i told u before that This function has the property that the image of each point in the complex plane is equidistant from that point and the origin right?
pitiful fish#4619,so
pitiful fish#4619,the function is f(z) = (a + bi)z
pitiful fish#4619,and a and b are positive numbers
pitiful fish#4619,|a + bi| = 8
pitiful fish#4619,find b^2
pitiful fish#4619,alright
flat fish#8597,yeah so i think you can just that
pitiful fish#4619,i think the formula for f(z) if z = c + di is something like cRe(z) + dIm(z) = d^2
pitiful fish#4619,wait
pitiful fish#4619,waht
pitiful fish#4619,no
pitiful fish#4619,non
pitiful fish#4619,o[
pitiful fish#4619,what
pitiful fish#4619,cRe(f(z)) + dIm(f(z)) = d^2
pitiful fish#4619,ok
pitiful fish#4619,there
pitiful fish#4619,thats correct

flat fish#8597,why don't you try expanding the second equation
flat fish#8597,then using b^2 - 4ac test
flat fish#8597,when you write chinese do you try to line up your words with those of the previous line because they're supposed to be full width squares
pitiful fish#4619,ok so
pitiful fish#4619,for first thing

flat fish#8597,bc is was like
flat fish#8597,all zoogles follow this property
flat fish#8597,"and the half of the class in a proof specified the things defining the zoogle, but didn't write a separate line specifying those things were a zoogle"
flat fish#8597,like
flat fish#8597,a median but i don't think it was a median
flat fish#8597,oh
flat fish#8597,vertical angles
flat fish#8597,probably

flat fish#8597,did you check the discussions
flat fish#8597,forum
pitiful fish#4619,nothing there
pitiful fish#4619,maybe im missing a solution?
pitiful fish#4619,i set x^2 - 4x + 2 = 1 as a solution
pitiful fish#4619,and x^2 - 5x + 2 = 0 as the other one
pitiful fish#4619,maybe 0^0?
pitiful fish#4619,or like
pitiful fish#4619,???????/
pitiful fish#4619,BRUH
pitiful fish#4619,i was missing solutions
pitiful fish#4619,hey
pitiful fish#4619,can u help
pitiful fish#4619,me
flat fish#8597,telle me problo
flat fish#8597,i  eat diner
flat fish#8597,no
flat fish#8597,w
flat fish#8597,so i may c ander latter
pitiful fish#4619,
pitiful fish#4619,i tried setting it equal to y
pitiful fish#4619,then solving for x
pitiful fish#4619,it gets messy but
pitiful fish#4619,its not right
pitiful fish#4619,idk how
pitiful fish#4619,also idk what the hint means
pitiful fish#4619,i feel pretty dumb in the dumb rn
pitiful fish#4619,maybe there is algebra error
pitiful fish#4619,let me check again
flat fish#8597,if two is in the range then there is an x such that
flat fish#8597,
flat fish#8597,= 2
pitiful fish#4619,right
pitiful fish#4619,i got that
pitiful fish#4619,wait
pitiful fish#4619,i made algebra mistake
flat fish#8597,
pitiful fish#4619,i am rechecking rn
flat fish#8597,= 2*
pitiful fish#4619,wait
pitiful fish#4619,yes
pitiful fish#4619,that is true
pitiful fish#4619,wait wait
pitiful fish#4619,so
pitiful fish#4619,yeah ok
flat fish#8597,ok so you can solve for x
pitiful fish#4619,yes i did
pitiful fish#4619,but
pitiful fish#4619,that
flat fish#8597,ok but actually you don't care what x is
pitiful fish#4619,yeah
flat fish#8597,you just care if x exists
flat fish#8597,i think
flat fish#8597,so
flat fish#8597,how do we know if x is real
flat fish#8597,as a solution to a quadratic
pitiful fish#4619,discrimination
flat fish#8597,yeah
flat fish#8597,yeah
pitiful fish#4619,wait
pitiful fish#4619,so can i put in an
pitiful fish#4619,ohhhh
pitiful fish#4619,i can put in an arbitrary y
pitiful fish#4619,then find the discriminant
pitiful fish#4619,then solve for
pitiful fish#4619,ohhhh
pitiful fish#4619,bruh
pitiful fish#4619,i am dummy dummy
flat fish#8597,BOOM BOOM
flat fish#8597,m
pitiful fish#4619,ok
pitiful fish#4619,so
pitiful fish#4619,discrimination
pitiful fish#4619,gives
pitiful fish#4619,-8(y-5)(y+4)
pitiful fish#4619,>= 0
pitiful fish#4619,so
pitiful fish#4619,"[-4, 5]"
pitiful fish#4619,alright
pitiful fish#4619,we are done

flat fish#8597,when the
flat fish#8597,is not
flat fish#8597,you see
flat fish#8597,-8
flat fish#8597,is a negative number
flat fish#8597,redo the inequality
pitiful fish#4619,yes i know
pitiful fish#4619,i already did
flat fish#8597,ok so how did you
flat fish#8597,wait
flat fish#8597,yeah how did you
pitiful fish#4619,if the parabola opens downwards then the part that is above zero will be finite
flat fish#8597,wa
pitiful fish#4619,so it cant be the one with infinities
pitiful fish#4619,BOOM BOOM
pitiful fish#4619,m
flat fish#8597,so you get (y-5)(y+4) <= 0
flat fish#8597,right
pitiful fish#4619,yeah
flat fish#8597,wait
pitiful fish#4619,i can recheck
pitiful fish#4619,again
pitiful fish#4619,wait

flat fish#8597,which is just = in cs
flat fish#8597,in python what := does is it does the same thing as = but it also returns the value of the right hand side
flat fish#8597,so like `x = 3` would set x to three but you could do `print(x := 3)`
flat fish#8597,in most other languages i think the assignemtn operator (=) already just returns the value but in python that was only exist throught the := added in 3.8
pitiful fish#4619,this problem is kinda brain
pitiful fish#4619,seal operator
flat fish#8597,fish operator???
pitiful fish#4619,pitiful fish operator.

pitiful fish#4619,i dont want him in my server
pitiful fish#4619,but im not gonna tell him that
flat fish#8597,i think best response is to say yes

pitiful fish#4619,please help
pitiful fish#4619,please help please help
pitiful fish#4619,please help please help please help please help
flat fish#8597,idk how to do it
pitiful fish#4619,we learned 4 theorems
pitiful fish#4619,division theorem
pitiful fish#4619,remainder theorem
pitiful fish#4619,and factor theorem
pitiful fish#4619,division states that f(x) = q(x)g(x) + r(x)
pitiful fish#4619,remainder states that when f(x) / (x - a) then f(a) is the remainder
pitiful fish#4619,factor is just that if f(a) = 0 then (x - a) is a factor
pitiful fish#4619,then we learned fundamental theorem of algebruh but that isnt helpful
pitiful fish#4619,please help
pitiful fish#4619,please help

flat fish#8597,yeah
flat fish#8597,featherman?
pitiful fish#4619,michelle make brain go pain pain
flat fish#8597,orz is japanese texting slang for disappointment
flat fish#8597,becuase it looks like a person with crossed arms
pitiful fish#4619,STINKY STUPID CONSTANT TERM
pitiful fish#4619,IF P(a) DIVIDES k(P(b)) THEN a IS NOT NECESSARILY bk BECAUSE THERE IS A STUPID CONSTANT TERM
pitiful fish#4619,
pitiful fish#4619,😭
flat fish#8597,do you need help solving that
pitiful fish#4619,wait
pitiful fish#4619,could i just say that n must be a multiple of the constant term and then solve for constant term = 1 separately
flat fish#8597,then what
flat fish#8597,solve for constant term = 1 separately?
pitiful fish#4619,yeah
pitiful fish#4619,i mean
pitiful fish#4619,like
pitiful fish#4619,prove than P(n) is composite for infinite n's when the constant term is 1
flat fish#8597,o
pitiful fish#4619,can i
flat fish#8597,probaly
pitiful fish#4619,can u help me
pitiful fish#4619,yehy
pitiful fish#4619,heye
pitiful fish#4619,hee
pitiful fish#4619,e
pitiful fish#4619,e
pitiful fish#4619,e
pitiful fish#4619,e
pitiful fish#4619,e
flat fish#8597,boob
pitiful fish#4619,can you pleasae help me
pitiful fish#4619,hint is that
pitiful fish#4619,P(a) - P(b) is divisible by a - b
pitiful fish#4619,so i wrote P(a) = (a - b)g(a) + P(b)
pitiful fish#4619,then i got P(a) = (a - 2)g(a) + P(2)
pitiful fish#4619,when b = 2
pitiful fish#4619,"for some values of a, g(a) is divisible by P(2)"
pitiful fish#4619,"specifically, it's mod P(2) * leading coefficient"
pitiful fish#4619,idk how to nail down the values of a so that g(a) is divisible by P(2) though
pitiful fish#4619,"just as an example, when P(x) = 5x^2 + 7x + 3, a = 4 works"
pitiful fish#4619,and a = 41
pitiful fish#4619,and a = 76
pitiful fish#4619,in this case these values work mod 37*5
pitiful fish#4619,so
pitiful fish#4619,mod 185
pitiful fish#4619,so like
pitiful fish#4619,189 works
pitiful fish#4619,and 226 works
pitiful fish#4619,and so on
pitiful fish#4619,actually in those cases g(a) is a multiple of 37
pitiful fish#4619,because g(a) is defined as (P(a) - P(b))/(a - b)
pitiful fish#4619,can u help
pitiful fish#4619,i feel like im going in circles
pitiful fish#4619,i think the answer is somewhere in what ive done

pitiful fish#4619,Q((1-sqrt(2))^8) = 0
flat fish#8597,that means (1-sqrt(2))^8 is a root i thinkk
pitiful fish#4619,yes thank you
flat fish#8597,OK UH
flat fish#8597,WELL
pitiful fish#4619,now we know by vieta
flat fish#8597,YOU KNOW THE OTHER ROOT
flat fish#8597,IS
flat fish#8597,THE CONJUGATE
pitiful fish#4619,yes
flat fish#8597,SO SOMETHING LIKE THAT WOULD WORK PROBABLY
pitiful fish#4619,i typed the conjugate
pitiful fish#4619,the question is 1 +
pitiful fish#4619,i typed 1 -
pitiful fish#4619,but now the issue arises
pitiful fish#4619,by vieta we have -((1+sqrt(2))^8 + (1-sqrt(2))^8) = b
flat fish#8597,wolfram alpha
pitiful fish#4619,AND
pitiful fish#4619,by vieta as WELL
pitiful fish#4619,we HAVE that
pitiful fish#4619,c = (1+sqrt(2))^8((1-sqrt(2))^8)
pitiful fish#4619,
pitiful fish#4619,SO NOW
pitiful fish#4619,ALL WE NEED TO DO IS ADD THEM
pitiful fish#4619,YAY

pitiful fish#4619,inducktion>
pitiful fish#4619,oh yeah induction works
pitiful fish#4619,can u just make sure my proof works
pitiful fish#4619,im gonna omit the base case because 11 = 11 mod 100
pitiful fish#4619,actually i just did the base case
pitiful fish#4619,ok well
pitiful fish#4619,assuming 11^k = 10k + 1 mod 100
pitiful fish#4619,we want to prove that 11^(k + 1) = 10(k + 1) + 1 mod 100
pitiful fish#4619,11^(k + 1) mod 100 = 11(10k + 1) mod 100 = 110k + 11 mod 100 = 10k + 11 mod 100 = 10k + 10 + 1 mod 100 = 10(k + 1) + 1 mod 100

flat fish#8597,and told me a hint which was that there was a guy name lagrange who liked to multiply things
flat fish#8597,so i needed lagrange multipliers it sounded like
stupid looking duck#7575,GLA8LVF4TF7CF7
stupid looking duck#7575,GLA8LVF4TF7CF7
flat fish#8597,wait you already got it?
flat fish#8597,thank you sir very much
stupid looking duck#7575,did it worky
flat fish#8597,haven't entered
flat fish#8597,i'm practicing an instrument
stupid looking duck#7575,oh ok
stupid looking duck#7575,you have to redeem at https://blizzard.wishpondpages.com/los_angeles_gladiators
flat fish#8597,jongy#11137
stupid looking duck#7575,jongy i need you please come to me
stupid looking duck#7575,i got the google foobar challenge
flat fish#8597,what
stupid looking duck#7575,vc?
flat fish#8597,k
stupid looking duck#7575,https://discord.gg/MsPeJjXW
flat fish#8597,is his name dylan
flat fish#8597,how's the foobar
stupid looking duck#7575,what if i sorted then just farmed the dupes in one loop?
flat fish#8597,farmed？
stupid looking duck#7575,since they're next to each other o(n)
flat fish#8597,what doesfarmed mean
stupid looking duck#7575,just quickly counted them
stupid looking duck#7575,its not like jargon
flat fish#8597,ah
stupid looking duck#7575,figure of speech
flat fish#8597,actually i think that's really good
flat fish#8597,yeah
stupid looking duck#7575,its less than 100 so sorting is gonna go fast
flat fish#8597,sort everything in a dictionary by its value
flat fish#8597,and put their indexes in the original list as the keyword for the values
flat fish#8597,then after sorting count
flat fish#8597,and then going through the dictionary is easy because the keywords
stupid looking duck#7575,theres no way i can get o(n) time with no auxiliary space right
flat fish#8597,are just incremental numenrs
flat fish#8597,idk
stupid looking duck#7575,hmm
flat fish#8597,arda don't count the whole list for the current value
flat fish#8597,i thought you were sorting it right?
stupid looking duck#7575,huh
stupid looking duck#7575,oh this is the old version
stupid looking duck#7575,i haven't pasted the new code yet
flat fish#8597,ah
stupid looking duck#7575,i passed with 100% and linear time
stupid looking duck#7575,on to stage 2
flat fish#8597,nice
flat fish#8597,https://discord.gg/dfMkfTc2
stupid looking duck#7575,I started problem 2
flat fish#8597,nice
stupid looking duck#7575,its like a weird pascal's triange
flat fish#8597,.
flat fish#8597,uh ok
flat fish#8597,what does that mean
flat fish#8597,like
flat fish#8597,i helped
flat fish#8597,or
stupid looking duck#7575,you get to do the thing too
stupid looking duck#7575,and get job
stupid looking duck#7575,mayabe
flat fish#8597,oh
flat fish#8597,wtf
flat fish#8597,lol you're giving me so much free stuff
stupid looking duck#7575,i mean
stupid looking duck#7575,you're prob most qualified

flat fish#8597,how do i
flat fish#8597,oh
stupid looking duck#7575,i gotchu
stupid looking duck#7575,btw remember that your code has to be literally flawless
stupid looking duck#7575,and add comments
flat fish#8597,comments
stupid looking duck#7575,#hello so this is me explaining my code here i multiplied x by y because i wanted xy
stupid looking duck#7575,"and indent a full ""tab"" after if statements, for loops"
stupid looking duck#7575,"if homosex == True:
|tab|gaming"
flat fish#8597,yeah
flat fish#8597,wait aren't the tabs required
stupid looking duck#7575,no a space can be used too
flat fish#8597,o
flat fish#8597,yeah
flat fish#8597,k so i think i've finiished?
flat fish#8597,we don't have same problesm right
flat fish#8597,so i can show oyu my code
flat fish#8597,just to see if it's clean
flat fish#8597,
stupid looking duck#7575,don't forget to use
stupid looking duck#7575,verify solutuion.py
flat fish#8597,yeah
flat fish#8597,i'm doing that
stupid looking duck#7575,ok
flat fish#8597,why does
stupid looking duck#7575,what
flat fish#8597,arda my values are correct
flat fish#8597,i don't
flat fish#8597,get it
flat fish#8597,what am i supposed to return
flat fish#8597,i've been doing this with william for 90 hours
flat fish#8597,look
flat fish#8597,WAHHHAHAHAHAA
flat fish#8597,what
flat fish#8597,that's my cdoe i didn't copy it form online
flat fish#8597,where
flat fish#8597,oh
flat fish#8597,where' my time
flat fish#8597,oh do i not see it
flat fish#8597,ok
flat fish#8597,ok ok isee
flat fish#8597,gn
stupid looking duck#7575,anotha one
stupid looking duck#7575,stage 3 33% done
flat fish#8597,have you gotten problem where you return a list
flat fish#8597,how do you do that
flat fish#8597,i think tha'ts why my solution is being wrong
flat fish#8597,the first problem i was having a similar problem where the values are the same as the answers but it's just wrong
flat fish#8597,but for the second problem where i needed to return an integer it was totally fine and i solved it first try
stupid looking duck#7575,return list?
stupid looking duck#7575,prob name
stupid looking duck#7575,jo gy
stupid looking duck#7575,when you get a referral link
stupid looking duck#7575,can i get it
stupid looking duck#7575,do you know BFS i need for problem
flat fish#8597,bruh this was level 2
stupid looking duck#7575,bruh what
flat fish#8597,i think i overthought it and tried to make it way too efficient
flat fish#8597,like
flat fish#8597,i tried to solve it as a math problem
stupid looking duck#7575,i just finished a fucking matrix adjacency traversal algorithm and fucked myself for 4 hours
flat fish#8597,so there would be a one liner formula i could use in the code and it would be super efficient
flat fish#8597,but i should ahve just done it using programming
flat fish#8597,lol
stupid looking duck#7575,bruh
flat fish#8597,what is matrix adjacency traversal algorithm
stupid looking duck#7575,like BFS with a tweak
stupid looking duck#7575,ill explain in vc later
flat fish#8597,are you using it for a problem
stupid looking duck#7575,yeah
flat fish#8597,tf
flat fish#8597,what lvel are you on
flat fish#8597,also how much time do i have to do the whole thing
flat fish#8597,like if i wait a month will they just stop the challenge
stupid looking duck#7575,no
stupid looking duck#7575,some people keep it waiting for like a whole year
flat fish#8597,1011010 & 1001011 = 1001010
stupid looking duck#7575,x & 1?
stupid looking duck#7575,while x > 1: if x & 1 ==1:
flat fish#8597,(x & 1) == 1
flat fish#8597,if x & 1
flat fish#8597,i'l brb 20 minn
stupid looking duck#7575,ok
flat fish#8597,oh wait maybe 30 but yeah
stupid looking duck#7575,ok
flat fish#8597,remi
stupid looking duck#7575,william is terrible at teaching
flat fish#8597,i kind of agree ngl
flat fish#8597,he just kind of hears from kai what he expects to hear
flat fish#8597,if he hears a right number he just gives it its own context

The order of the rows follows the same pattern (start, each bunny, bulkhead). The bunnies can jump into your arms, so picking them up is instantaneous, and arriving at the bulkhead at the same time as it seals still allows for a successful, if dramatic, escape. (Don't worry, any bunnies you don't pick up will be able to escape with you since they no longer have to carry the ones you did pick up.) You can revisit different spots if you wish, and moving to the bulkhead doesn't mean you have to immediately leave - you can move to and from the bulkhead to pick up additional bunnies if time permits."
stupid looking duck#7575,"In addition to spending time traveling between bunnies, some paths interact with the space station's security checkpoints and add time back to the clock. Adding time to the clock will delay the closing of the bulkhead doors, and if the time goes back up to 0 or a positive number after the doors have already closed, it triggers the bulkhead to reopen. Therefore, it might be possible to walk in a circle and keep gaining time: that is, each time a path is traversed, the same amount of time is used or added.
Write a function of the form solution(times, time_limit) to calculate the most bunnies you can pick up and which bunnies they are, while still escaping through the bulkhead before the doors close for good. If there are multiple sets of bunnies of the same size, return the set of bunnies with the lowest prisoner IDs (as indexes) in sorted order. The bunnies are represented as a sorted list by prisoner ID, with the first bunny being 0. There are at most 5 bunnies, and time_limit is a non-negative integer that is at most 999."
flat fish#8597,ok i think
flat fish#8597,it just means
flat fish#8597,to get from A to B
flat fish#8597,it takes times[A][B] units of time
stupid looking duck#7575,clarify
flat fish#8597,like
flat fish#8597,to get from bunny 2 to bunny 1
flat fish#8597,it takes 2 units of time
flat fish#8597,because you look at the row for bunny 2
flat fish#8597,and go to the column for bunny 1
flat fish#8597,which is time[3][2]
stupid looking duck#7575,wait bunny 1 or bunny 0
flat fish#8597,bunny 1
flat fish#8597,yeah for some reason
flat fish#8597,the time to get from A to B can be different than getting from B to A
stupid looking duck#7575,dude
stupid looking duck#7575,wha
stupid looking duck#7575,a
flat fish#8597,that's just the problem i guess
flat fish#8597,maybe there's wind along the path which pushes you there faster
flat fish#8597,idfk
stupid looking duck#7575,yeah i have 14 days for this prob i'll be fine if I actually try every day
flat fish#8597,14 days?
flat fish#8597,what
stupid looking duck#7575,yeah stage 4 gives 14 days
flat fish#8597,oh
flat fish#8597,so once you reach stage 4 it resets
stupid looking duck#7575,the problems are naturally harder
flat fish#8597,
flat fish#8597,first do this

flat fish#8597,"Find the Access Codes
=====================
In order to destroy Commander Lambda's LAMBCHOP doomsday device, you'll need access to it. But the only door leading to the LAMBCHOP chamber is secured with a unique lock system whose number of passcodes changes daily. Commander Lambda gets a report every day that includes the locks' access codes, but only she knows how to figure out which of several lists contains the access codes. You need to find a way to determine which list contains the access codes once you're ready to go in. 
Fortunately, now that you're Commander Lambda's personal assistant, she's confided to you that she made all the access codes ""lucky triples"" in order to help her better find them in the lists. A ""lucky triple"" is a tuple (x, y, z) where x divides y and y divides z, such as (1, 2, 4). With that information, you can figure out which list contains the number of access codes that matches the number of locks on the door when you're ready to go in (for example, if there's 5 passcodes, you'd need to find a list with 5 ""lucky triple"" access codes).
Write a function solution(l) that takes a list of positive integers l and counts the number of ""lucky triples"" of (li, lj, lk) where the list indices meet the requirement i < j < k.  The length of l is between 2 and 2000 inclusive.  The elements of l are between 1 and 999999 inclusive.  The answer fits within a signed 32-bit integer. Some of the lists are purposely generated without any access codes to throw off spies, so if no triples are found, return 0. 
For example, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] has the triples: [1, 2, 4], [1, 2, 6], [1, 3, 6], making the answer 3 total."

stupid looking duck#7575,no
stupid looking duck#7575,i just figured out how to solve
stupid looking duck#7575,and since there's no quirks on the algorithms ill prob be done by tuesday
flat fish#8597,o
stupid looking duck#7575,yeah
stupid looking duck#7575,so the input is a graph right

stupid looking duck#7575,I bid thee farewell
flat fish#8597,goond
stupid looking duck#7575,jomby
flat fish#8597,arba
stupid looking duck#7575,so like
stupid looking duck#7575,you know arithmetic sequences
flat fish#8597,i know arithmetic sequences
stupid looking duck#7575,what are they called if the we're calculating up to infinity
flat fish#8597,infinite arithmetic sequences
stupid looking duck#7575,😐
stupid looking duck#7575,jomby
flat fish#8597,arba
stupid looking duck#7575,so like
stupid looking duck#7575,you know sequences
flat fish#8597,are these pet names for our new relationship
stupid looking duck#7575,yes
flat fish#8597,i know sequences
stupid looking duck#7575,why do we use n-1 when summing
flat fish#8597,for what equation do you ask that?
stupid looking duck#7575,uh
stupid looking duck#7575,sum of an arithmetic sequence
stupid looking duck#7575,where n is a known value
flat fish#8597,n is the term
flat fish#8597,d is the difference
flat fish#8597,a is the first term
stupid looking duck#7575,yes
flat fish#8597,you see
flat fish#8597,2a + (n-1)d is the sum of a and a + (n-1)d
stupid looking duck#7575,oh tits
stupid looking duck#7575,we start with 1
stupid looking duck#7575,every sequence starts with 1 right
stupid looking duck#7575,which is why we remove 1
flat fish#8597,uh
flat fish#8597,i mean
flat fish#8597,i always start with 0
stupid looking duck#7575,so then do you remove 1 from n
stupid looking duck#7575,oh
flat fish#8597,well i'm not sure what the meaning of starting from 1 is
flat fish#8597,i use the first term is a_0
stupid looking duck#7575,carry on
flat fish#8597,ok so the first term is a_0 + 0 * d
flat fish#8597,then the nth term is a_0 + (n-1) * d
stupid looking duck#7575,aha
stupid looking duck#7575,understanding
flat fish#8597,that's my good well-sized arba
stupid looking duck#7575,true indeed your rotundity
stupid looking duck#7575,my dear jomby i have yet another inquiry
flat fish#8597,demand.
stupid looking duck#7575,does an infinite arithmetic sequence exist
stupid looking duck#7575,or is it strictly arithmeticogeometric
flat fish#8597,"as an example, 1/n^2"
stupid looking duck#7575,and thats arithmetic
flat fish#8597,no it is not arithmetic
stupid looking duck#7575,exactly
stupid looking duck#7575,so where is the infinite arithmetic sequence
stupid looking duck#7575,theres infinite geometric ones
flat fish#8597,well of course it doesn't exist
stupid looking duck#7575,of course?
flat fish#8597,well
flat fish#8597,if a = d = 0 then i guess so
flat fish#8597,that would be
stupid looking duck#7575,i mean
flat fish#8597,a the thing
stupid looking duck#7575,like say
stupid looking duck#7575,"{1,2,3,4,...}"
stupid looking duck#7575,isn't that infine
flat fish#8597,yep
stupid looking duck#7575,so there exists an infinet arithmetic sequence
stupid looking duck#7575,oh but like
stupid looking duck#7575,it doesn't exist as in
stupid looking duck#7575,we can't calculate it ?
flat fish#8597,well i didn't know you meant that
stupid looking duck#7575,"what could i mean by ""infinite arithmetic sequence"""
flat fish#8597,one that converges
stupid looking duck#7575,oh
stupid looking duck#7575,oh
stupid looking duck#7575,we literally can't calculate arithmetic infint sequences
stupid looking duck#7575,because they are like infinite
stupid looking duck#7575,meister
stupid looking duck#7575,my final question
stupid looking duck#7575,somewhat unrelated to previous questions
stupid looking duck#7575,how

flat fish#8597,i an idea
stupid looking duck#7575,go on
flat fish#8597,could i run a python script with javascript
stupid looking duck#7575,maybe
flat fish#8597,and like
flat fish#8597,get the result
flat fish#8597,then i could use gpt
stupid looking duck#7575,porbably
stupid looking duck#7575,jongy
flat fish#8597,yes man
stupid looking duck#7575,take the machine laerning course instead
stupid looking duck#7575,much better use of time
flat fish#8597,but this would take 3 seconds no
stupid looking duck#7575,oh you typed
stupid looking duck#7575,um uh
stupid looking duck#7575,yeah probably
stupid looking duck#7575,go for it
stupid looking duck#7575,just copy some random's code
flat fish#8597,send me your code
stupid looking duck#7575,doesn't really work that way good sir
stupid looking duck#7575,my bot's in python
stupid looking duck#7575,plus i have my model on huggingface
flat fish#8597,yes but
flat fish#8597,you don't have the lines for the training or somethign?
flat fish#8597,do not know how this works
stupid looking duck#7575,ok
stupid looking duck#7575,firstly
stupid looking duck#7575,just copy and paste a lot of conversations
stupid looking duck#7575,or just find like a movie script
stupid looking duck#7575,then send to me
stupid looking duck#7575,i will format for you since i am a nice person 🙂
stupid looking duck#7575,actually
stupid looking duck#7575,i can do basically all of it i think
stupid looking duck#7575,you would just have to git push
stupid looking duck#7575,just get text and send it to me
stupid looking duck#7575,then you can call from huggingface API
flat fish#8597,i'll send you my conversations with walmartceo himself but probably do not read through it because there is mega brain damage and cringe!
stupid looking duck#7575,or i can send you the script and you can parse on ur own
stupid looking duck#7575,but know i will not read
flat fish#8597,i trust you
flat fish#8597,arba
stupid looking duck#7575,jomby my beloved
stupid looking duck#7575,you can write a little scraper to scrape for you

flat fish#8597,there are 200k dms between walmartceo and me

flat fish#8597,loook
flat fish#8597,ok
flat fish#8597,listen

flat fish#8597,HOW DO WE GET NEGAETEIE
flat fish#8597,if abs
flat fish#8597,IT SAYS FIND THE SIGNED DISTANCE
flat fish#8597,
flat fish#8597,person
flat fish#8597,i don't get it
flat fish#8597,how are they asking for signed distance
flat fish#8597,but the answer has abs
flat fish#8597,and denominator is also positive
flat fish#8597,???????????????????????????????????????????????
flat fish#8597,it explains
flat fish#8597,in the porblme
flat fish#8597,k well
flat fish#8597,in the meantime
flat fish#8597,farewell
flat fish#8597,i mean at least i could solve the part that they want right
flat fish#8597,why is it abs
flat fish#8597,at least  i did the rest
flat fish#8597,where the meat is
flat fish#8597,the meaty rest
stupid looking duck#7575,the meaty medium
flat fish#8597,the mega meaty medium
stupid looking duck#7575,the monstrous meaty medium
flat fish#8597,oh it
flat fish#8597,i've just remembered
flat fish#8597,in analysis we learned it like in the links above right
flat fish#8597,so like Ax + By + Cz + d / sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)
flat fish#8597,the
flat fish#8597,it's
flat fish#8597,the
flat fish#8597,it's
flat fish#8597,i thikn <A B C> is a vector normal to the plane
flat fish#8597,so that's why they use a normal theta vector in their equation
flat fish#8597,it makes sense now
flat fish#8597,instead of writing it standard form Ax + By + Cz = D they use theta which is <A B C> and x which is <x y z> so when they dot it's the same thing and theta_0 = d
flat fish#8597,because they have more than three dimensions
flat fish#8597,so writing it in standard form wiht letters is that is that is a not smart
stupid looking duck#7575,that was a good read
stupid looking duck#7575,do you get how there can be an x1 x2 plane
flat fish#8597,No
stupid looking duck#7575,i mean
stupid looking duck#7575,not plane
stupid looking duck#7575,but coordinate plane
stupid looking duck#7575,are you on lectures yet

UnaDripper#8496,Its an actual masterpiece tho
UnaDripper#8496,not just in anime but in shows

UnaDripper#8496,That shit is wack
UnaDripper#8496,I can say confidently that aot is far better
UnaDripper#8496,And besides nothing monogatari related is coming out soon
UnaDripper#8496,Get caught up with aot and you can watch s4 as it airs
flat fish#8597,but uh also bakemonogatari is shorter
flat fish#8597,monogatari
UnaDripper#8496,The whole series it prob longer
UnaDripper#8496,*is
UnaDripper#8496,There’s like
UnaDripper#8496,"Owarimonogatari, bakemonogatari, and a bunch of others"
flat fish#8597,ohhh
flat fish#8597,that was just first season arcs
UnaDripper#8496,Yeah
UnaDripper#8496,There’s a lot more
UnaDripper#8496,But if your looking for something short
UnaDripper#8496,Mob psycho 100 is prob one of the best
flat fish#8597,i watched that
UnaDripper#8496,Ok good
UnaDripper#8496,S2 as well?
flat fish#8597,mmh m
UnaDripper#8496,I’m assuming that’s yes
UnaDripper#8496,But dude aot is fucking great
UnaDripper#8496,All seasons are good but it keeps getting better
UnaDripper#8496,And S4 is definitely the best fucking anime season of all time
flat fish#8597,do you know if japanese teens actually tell each other to die a lot
flat fish#8597,i saw it happen a lot in bunny girl
UnaDripper#8496,On the internet people legit say it
UnaDripper#8496,But irl yeah they still do
UnaDripper#8496,Like when someone makes some perverted joke
flat fish#8597,uh
UnaDripper#8496,Usually girls are the ones who say it
flat fish#8597,ok but if it's not perverted
flat fish#8597,is it still normal
UnaDripper#8496,Yeah it’s basically just fuck your self
flat fish#8597,i mean yeah i guess if it's when perverted and if sakuta is the main character we would hear it a lot
UnaDripper#8496,Yeah
flat fish#8597,i'm thinking about watching konosuba
UnaDripper#8496,Dude
UnaDripper#8496,It’s good
UnaDripper#8496,But fucking watch aot
flat fish#8597,"i would watch hxh this month, i told my sister"
UnaDripper#8496,The first episode comes in 5 days
UnaDripper#8496,Set your priorities straight
flat fish#8597,if first episode of next season comes in five days why would i watch it now
UnaDripper#8496,so you can start getting caught up
UnaDripper#8496,and its way fucking better than hxh
UnaDripper#8496,its a good show but aot is better
flat fish#8597,no the thing is the first anime i watched was yuyu hakusho and she said hxh is basically what the author of yyh wanted to do but couldn't because long or something
flat fish#8597,idk
UnaDripper#8496,wow what the fuck
UnaDripper#8496,is your sister a total weeb or something

UnaDripper#8496,aot is awesome
UnaDripper#8496,it isnt overhyped one bit
UnaDripper#8496,I mean the first season is already good

UnaDripper#8496,its just for you to get a quick laugh
UnaDripper#8496,sure its shorter but aot is far better

My blood and mucus and shit and cum would all mix together and soak into Oval Office's carpet, to be trodden upon by President Kamala's divinely blessed feet long after my broken corpse has been unceremoniously dumped in the Atlantic by my mocha colored queen and her Secret Service bulls."

flat fish#8597,money poo
UnaDripper#8496,I’m gonna spend my college savings on valorant skins
flat fish#8597,i couldn't see them actually making prime phantom
UnaDripper#8496,Same
flat fish#8597,i felt like phantom was too light to match the theme you know
UnaDripper#8496,But it looks cool
UnaDripper#8496,Yeah
UnaDripper#8496,I think the knife looks like
UnaDripper#8496,Garbage
UnaDripper#8496,The animations are so cool but
UnaDripper#8496,It looks like a 1st grade art project
UnaDripper#8496,Like they put together 2 pieces of cardboard
UnaDripper#8496,Which vaguely resembled a knife
flat fish#8597,high tech banana peel
UnaDripper#8496,Yeah
UnaDripper#8496,It looks skinnier and smaller than me dude
UnaDripper#8496,Holy shit dude
UnaDripper#8496,I wish they would release a real fucking karambit with animations
UnaDripper#8496,Not that dogshit
flat fish#8597,in league of legends riot just continues skin lines for years but that might be different from valorant
flat fish#8597,every year they would release a new set of PROJECT skins
UnaDripper#8496,I think
UnaDripper#8496,They will make new skins
UnaDripper#8496,But definitely capitalize on the popular bundles
UnaDripper#8496,Like the glitchpop and prime
UnaDripper#8496,But ‘discontinue’ the less popular ones
flat fish#8597,i hope they make project skins in valorant
UnaDripper#8496,What are those
flat fish#8597,k idk if you want to but look at some splash arts for league of legends project skins
UnaDripper#8496,Ok

UnaDripper#8496,"My name is Yoshimpostor Amogus. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Electric, where all the wirings are, and I am not sus. I work as a crewmate for the Space Ship, and I get to the cafeteria every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't sabotage, but I occasionally vent. I'm in Cameras by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of vigilance, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a crewmate, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last scan. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to evict I wouldn't lose to anyone."

flat fish#8597,you could probably stand on it like a tripod
flat fish#8597,and that's not even mentioning how fat your nuts are

UnaDripper#8496,Also jongy is league playable without audio
flat fish#8597,eeeE
flat fish#8597,not really
flat fish#8597,for example
flat fish#8597,pyke w

UnaDripper#8496,bruh
UnaDripper#8496,professional caitlyn gameplay
UnaDripper#8496,
flat fish#8597,damn
UnaDripper#8496,senna adc
flat fish#8597,booboo
flat fish#8597,well the thing is
flat fish#8597,when they designed senna
flat fish#8597,another support
flat fish#8597,they were like ok we made assassin support and everybody loved that so let's make an adc support
flat fish#8597,and then she became an actual adc
flat fish#8597,so in her kit she harvests souls which improve her stats at certain amounts collected
flat fish#8597,so instead of farming gold she could farm souls
flat fish#8597,i mean she still needed gold ofc but
flat fish#8597,she didn't need all of it
flat fish#8597,so there is this cancer strateg
flat fish#8597,where you go tahm kench + senna botlane
flat fish#8597,senna is supposed to be the adc and tahm kench is supposed to be the support (usually he is played top btw but he can support)
flat fish#8597,but tahm kench gets the farm for the majority of laning phase
flat fish#8597,senna just brings support item and farms souls
flat fish#8597,and she is just as powerful
flat fish#8597,really any support works but tahm kench has great peel so it's turbo giga cancer with senna
flat fish#8597,they did it in proplay and it was help

UnaDripper#8496,"My cousin was recently hit by a car, and was paralyzed from the waste down. The doctors said that he wouldn’t be able to walk again but then I accidentally turned this on and he got up, took my phone, and kicked it out of a window. He is now a professional soccer player by the name of Lionel Messi. Thank you 🙏🏿."

UnaDripper#8496,how the fuck
UnaDripper#8496,do you play pyke
flat fish#8597,bruh
flat fish#8597,well first of all he's melee so don't take free damage until you and your adc can fight
flat fish#8597,and don't waste your mana
flat fish#8597,for example
flat fish#8597,even if you hit your q level 1
flat fish#8597,what are you guys going to do next
flat fish#8597,there is no way to follow up
flat fish#8597,uh
flat fish#8597,after you hit q immediately e
flat fish#8597,w to sneak up or escape
flat fish#8597,your passive gives you healing out of enemy vision
flat fish#8597,and your w makes your invisible outside a radius
flat fish#8597,and remember you are an assassin
flat fish#8597,not a mage
UnaDripper#8496,never playing pyke again
flat fish#8597,just like how
flat fish#8597,you
flat fish#8597,never played

UnaDripper#8496,holy shit tho I’m so deep in the rabbit hole
UnaDripper#8496,what have I become

UnaDripper#8496,I would carry with brand!!!! : )
UnaDripper#8496,Jongy
UnaDripper#8496,Who do you think I should learn
UnaDripper#8496,Someone strong who needs skill but not extremely hard
UnaDripper#8496,that can do damage
flat fish#8597,which  roles
UnaDripper#8496,doesn’t really matter
UnaDripper#8496,just a character you think would suit me
flat fish#8597,k first do this
flat fish#8597,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1meBhKqYeDkQfi2sNc74YP4KC97HbP4T3lHNnnf0T4pw/edit#gid=564264113
UnaDripper#8496,k
flat fish#8597,k there are instrucitons
flat fish#8597,but
flat fish#8597,tldr
flat fish#8597,only fill in columns named priority and dps
flat fish#8597,i mean
flat fish#8597,not dps
flat fish#8597,the one to the right of priority
flat fish#8597,priority is how much you value that stat
flat fish#8597,1 to 5
flat fish#8597,so you probably want to put 5 in damage
flat fish#8597,etc
UnaDripper#8496,k
flat fish#8597,you can have multiple of a number but don't have like 4 5s you know
flat fish#8597,ok so in the column to the right of the priority column
flat fish#8597,enter integer 1 to 5
UnaDripper#8496,not sure if I can do on phone
flat fish#8597,the one to the right of that will be updated automatically and will be complemtary with your entered number to 5
flat fish#8597,so if you put 1
flat fish#8597,the other will say 4
flat fish#8597,and this is because like
flat fish#8597,example
flat fish#8597,in damage
flat fish#8597,you either want dps or burst

flat fish#8597,ar eyou gonna play blitzcrank
UnaDripper#8496,no
UnaDripper#8496,i would fucking commit seppuku
UnaDripper#8496,and then go to hell obviously
UnaDripper#8496,where blitzcrank players belong
flat fish#8597,commit seppuku
flat fish#8597,not poggers
flat fish#8597,not kek
UnaDripper#8496,jongy
UnaDripper#8496,what is everfrost
UnaDripper#8496,the item
flat fish#8597,you slow in a cone in front of you
UnaDripper#8496,people are saying it’s good on echo because of a buff it got
UnaDripper#8496,k
flat fish#8597,but people in the middle are rooted
UnaDripper#8496,because a lot of people are saying that the rocket belt is not that good
UnaDripper#8496,and that everfrost might be betyer
flat fish#8597,maybe
flat fish#8597,idk
UnaDripper#8496,but conceptually
UnaDripper#8496,do you think it would work on ekko
flat fish#8597,idk it seems like rocketbelt would be better but maybe stats or something
UnaDripper#8496,
UnaDripper#8496,rocket belt
UnaDripper#8496,
UnaDripper#8496,everfrost
flat fish#8597,seems like rockelbelt would be better
UnaDripper#8496,k
flat fish#8597,well
flat fish#8597,do you think you can kill them
flat fish#8597,if it's like
UnaDripper#8496,I mean
flat fish#8597,5 tanks
UnaDripper#8496,I do use rocketbelt a decent amount
UnaDripper#8496,it does very good burst
flat fish#8597,yeah
UnaDripper#8496,bc you can q e w auto rocketbelt auto
UnaDripper#8496,bc it resets ur auto
UnaDripper#8496,so you can also e auto rocket auto
flat fish#8597,well usually you e first i think
UnaDripper#8496,insta proc passive
flat fish#8597,wow you know about auto cancels now
UnaDripper#8496,yeah I meant the q e animation cancel
UnaDripper#8496,you use both at the same time
UnaDripper#8496,maximize burst
flat fish#8597,i
flat fish#8597,think e q is faster
flat fish#8597,and more range on q
UnaDripper#8496,yeah the animation cancel is higher risk
UnaDripper#8496,but I’m usually able to hit
UnaDripper#8496,I use e and q for ranged matchups
UnaDripper#8496,or vc
UnaDripper#8496,cc
UnaDripper#8496,https://youtu.be/Z61arvQVIx8
UnaDripper#8496,I know this dude is way way better than me
UnaDripper#8496,but the way he uses everfrost with the rest of his very quirky build
UnaDripper#8496,actually works
flat fish#8597,if you're playing ekko watch maxske i would say
UnaDripper#8496,ok
UnaDripper#8496,I still haven’t gotten an s yet
UnaDripper#8496,but hopefully this weekend or something
UnaDripper#8496,also jongy
UnaDripper#8496,ekko is actual a bit difficult
UnaDripper#8496,definitely way harder than brand or lux
flat fish#8597,well yeah he has more mobility
UnaDripper#8496,mobility characters harder?
UnaDripper#8496,ok maxske is good
UnaDripper#8496,but holy shit he sound so annoying
flat fish#8597,yeah
flat fish#8597,i just got used to it
UnaDripper#8496,bruh
flat fish#8597,and i think it's just something his fan base likes

UnaDripper#8496,jongy
UnaDripper#8496,if I do play jungle
UnaDripper#8496,Who should I play
UnaDripper#8496,Since there are better options than ekko
flat fish#8597,can try kayn
flat fish#8597,ad super mobile assassin/bruiser
UnaDripper#8496,yeah he looks good
UnaDripper#8496,is he easy
flat fish#8597,you can choose is what was unique about him
flat fish#8597,basically he is this guy right
flat fish#8597,but his blade is cursed
UnaDripper#8496,mhm
flat fish#8597,with demon man
UnaDripper#8496,yeah
flat fish#8597,so in gam
flat fish#8597,you get a choice
flat fish#8597,so either the demon wins
flat fish#8597,or kayn wins
UnaDripper#8496,that’s pretty cool
flat fish#8597,if kayn then you're an assassin
flat fish#8597,if azakana demon wins
flat fish#8597,bruiser
flat fish#8597,it's not as cool because usually your runes decide which you're going
flat fish#8597,and also bruiser is infinitely better
flat fish#8597,or was
flat fish#8597,idk anymore
UnaDripper#8496,ok
UnaDripper#8496,so wait
UnaDripper#8496,can you alternate

UnaDripper#8496,ok
UnaDripper#8496,i just dont want to be a one trick
UnaDripper#8496,bc there are a fair amount of bad matchups for ekko mid
UnaDripper#8496,bc there are a bunch more stronger mid laners
UnaDripper#8496,are there any other strong mid laners that would be good for me
flat fish#8597,neeko

flat fish#8597,k so what happened
flat fish#8597,after they left on blimp
flat fish#8597,and sasha died
flat fish#8597,is that when the time jump happened
UnaDripper#8496,this is before all shit went down
UnaDripper#8496,after s3
UnaDripper#8496,then theres a 4 year time skip i think
UnaDripper#8496,forgot how long
UnaDripper#8496,and then the marley battle
flat fish#8597,i'm on episode 69
flat fish#8597,eren [he]
flat fish#8597,ok so this is after they attacked marley
flat fish#8597,when did they meet the marleyans
flat fish#8597,and make a relationship with one of them
flat fish#8597,or two
flat fish#8597,the blonde and black guys
UnaDripper#8496,how far through are you
UnaDripper#8496,in the ep
flat fish#8597,alksot done
UnaDripper#8496,"Two years ago, Eren and others of the Scout Regiment meet with Yelena and the Anti-Marleyan Volunteers at the port on Paradis Island to welcome their first outside visitor. It is Kiyomi Azumabito from Hizuru, the lone nation on friendly terms with Paradis."
flat fish#8597,two years before this episode?
flat fish#8597,was that after the attack on marley
UnaDripper#8496,two years before attack on marley
flat fish#8597,ok
flat fish#8597,can you give summary up to episdoe 69
flat fish#8597,if you have time
flat fish#8597,or want to
flat fish#8597,i can also look at wiki ummary
UnaDripper#8496,so attack on marley is 4 years after events of s3
UnaDripper#8496,inbetween that they meet black guy and yelena
UnaDripper#8496,with hizuru woman
UnaDripper#8496,they come with message saying that zeke wants to buttfuck marley
UnaDripper#8496,people are like no that sound kinda sus
UnaDripper#8496,but eren goes anyways
UnaDripper#8496,to get zeke
UnaDripper#8496,they get zeke
UnaDripper#8496,come back
UnaDripper#8496,but now the scouts and military are mad at eren and zeke
UnaDripper#8496,bc the plan was selfish and people died
UnaDripper#8496,so now they separate zeke and eren

UnaDripper#8496,ive played azir like 15 times
UnaDripper#8496,no hes not
UnaDripper#8496,ekko has 61% wr against azir
UnaDripper#8496,highest of all champs
flat fish#8597,k azir requires at least 5 hands and 2 heads
flat fish#8597,maybe that's why?
UnaDripper#8496,i guess
flat fish#8597,idk why ekko would be easyagainst azir
flat fish#8597,tlaon or yasuo vs azir is turbo cancer
UnaDripper#8496,
UnaDripper#8496,it got lower
UnaDripper#8496,but before it was 60%

UnaDripper#8496,well you want to get skins for the two you play the most
flat fish#8597,is blood moon or battle queen katarina
flat fish#8597,the irelia and akali skins in my shop are good and the only options because they are 50%+ off which is actually op
flat fish#8597,blood moon kat is also 50% off but her legendary skin battle queen kat is 25% off
flat fish#8597,so i'm not sure which to get
flat fish#8597,the legenary skin is currently at the price of an epic skin which is the normal price of blood moon kat you see
UnaDripper#8496,oh
UnaDripper#8496,i get it now
flat fish#8597,man vc guy?
UnaDripper#8496,ok

UnaDripper#8496,after lnad
flat fish#8597,"against talon, build armor"
flat fish#8597,esp on ap champions
flat fish#8597,build seeker's armguard
flat fish#8597,which gives armor and ap and is generally just super good to get early
flat fish#8597,and it builds into stopwatch
UnaDripper#8496,yeah i build
flat fish#8597,which also counters talon
UnaDripper#8496,but then he out cs
UnaDripper#8496,i cant do damage bc use 100 gold
UnaDripper#8496,*1000
flat fish#8597,it's not your job to out cs
flat fish#8597,he will fall off
flat fish#8597,and you will win
UnaDripper#8496,i guess
flat fish#8597,if he's not 10/0
flat fish#8597,because you fed him
flat fish#8597,now
flat fish#8597,he's frustrating
flat fish#8597,because
flat fish#8597,if he's not killing you
UnaDripper#8496,yeah see thats what happen
flat fish#8597,he can just wlak bot lane and kill your brain damage team mate
UnaDripper#8496,he clears wave with his amazing wave clear
flat fish#8597,but i mean that's like
flat fish#8597,any champion
UnaDripper#8496,he walks bot massacre
UnaDripper#8496,hes 5/0
UnaDripper#8496,and then everyone saying mid diff
flat fish#8597,but yeah any mid laner is supposed to roam
UnaDripper#8496,but he just roams better
UnaDripper#8496,his fucking gay ass fucking wings
UnaDripper#8496,he goes in and then he gets flash on like 10 sec cooldown
UnaDripper#8496,impossible to fucking cathc
flat fish#8597,flahs on 10 sec cooldown?
UnaDripper#8496,his gay jump
UnaDripper#8496,fucking fluttering over 5 walls
UnaDripper#8496,like a goddamn butterfly
flat fish#8597,his jump is on 2 second cooldown but puts the wall on cooldown for at least a few minutes
UnaDripper#8496,"Talon vaults over any terrain or structure, up to a max distance. This ability has a low cooldown, but puts the used terrain on a long cooldown."
UnaDripper#8496,only the wall
UnaDripper#8496,but then he jumps over the next wall
UnaDripper#8496,and the next
UnaDripper#8496,until hes gone
UnaDripper#8496,by that time hes got a kill or two
UnaDripper#8496,gets lots of item
UnaDripper#8496,comes back and he just rapes
flat fish#8597,ping your bot lane so they won't die
flat fish#8597,and if they still do
flat fish#8597,then it's not mid diff
UnaDripper#8496,yeah
flat fish#8597,because you pinged them to back off
UnaDripper#8496,but they will still say
UnaDripper#8496,i always ping
UnaDripper#8496,i fucking spam that shit
flat fish#8597,then it's not your fault
UnaDripper#8496,! ! ! ! !
flat fish#8597,eitehr say that or mute them
flat fish#8597,if it bothers you
UnaDripper#8496,then they never support me
UnaDripper#8496,and my opinion is seen as completely irrelevant
UnaDripper#8496,bc im 'losing lane'
flat fish#8597,statistically that bot lane will also be on the enemy team
flat fish#8597,everyone always thinks they are the unlucky player
flat fish#8597,which clearly isn't true
flat fish#8597,the enemy will also get that bot lane the same number of times
flat fish#8597,and while those bot lanes stay silver you'll be challenger!
UnaDripper#8496,yeah but the other thing
UnaDripper#8496,way harder for sylas to roam
UnaDripper#8496,hes not fast
UnaDripper#8496,and its hard to engage without protobelt or everfrost
UnaDripper#8496,which is 12+
flat fish#8597,because sylas gets more sustain as a bruiser for fighting
flat fish#8597,you can't have everything
UnaDripper#8496,i play burst sylas
UnaDripper#8496,not bruiser
flat fish#8597,he eheaAaah ehehehe ee aaAA 1 1 WWOO
UnaDripper#8496,rocketbelt horizon focus
UnaDripper#8496,first 2 item
UnaDripper#8496,
UnaDripper#8496,
UnaDripper#8496,and it works
UnaDripper#8496,quite well
UnaDripper#8496,
UnaDripper#8496,
UnaDripper#8496,gaming
UnaDripper#8496,also jongy
UnaDripper#8496,whats utility score
flat fish#8597,honestly i have no clue
UnaDripper#8496,bc its lower than the average iron
UnaDripper#8496,which seems bad
UnaDripper#8496,is that like ward?
flat fish#8597,somehow my utility usage is worse on talon than the average player but i'm not really sure how i'm supposed to be healing or cc'ing people
flat fish#8597,i think talon w has a slow very slight slow so maybe that's what it is?
flat fish#8597,but yeah i'm pretty sure utility is healing cc'ing helping your team in those ways
UnaDripper#8496,oh ok
UnaDripper#8496,i mean i engage pretty often
UnaDripper#8496,successful or not
UnaDripper#8496,and my e counts as cc
UnaDripper#8496,ults count as well
UnaDripper#8496,
UnaDripper#8496,not surprised
flat fish#8597,bruh
flat fish#8597,i only watched an episode but the show is just
flat fish#8597,cringe
flat fish#8597,i don't think there's another word
flat fish#8597,it's so hard to watch
flat fish#8597,the main character
flat fish#8597,is not a fun to watch
UnaDripper#8496,yeah
UnaDripper#8496,manga better
UnaDripper#8496,it’s just the
UnaDripper#8496,ay yooo
UnaDripper#8496,so bad on screen
flat fish#8597,and like
flat fish#8597,i remember
flat fish#8597,main character
flat fish#8597,kept sniffing
flat fish#8597,actually
flat fish#8597,help
flat fish#8597,in the brain cell
UnaDripper#8496,yeah he’s a dump
UnaDripper#8496,*simp
UnaDripper#8496,fuckinf retard
UnaDripper#8496,but yeah character development ish
UnaDripper#8496,kinda
flat fish#8597,but when you start the show like that
flat fish#8597,i'm not even interested
flat fish#8597,in how he'll develop
UnaDripper#8496,yeah
UnaDripper#8496,it’s not a must watch
UnaDripper#8496,it’s ok
UnaDripper#8496,manga is good
UnaDripper#8496,have you start jjk
flat fish#8597,no
UnaDripper#8496,also can you play
UnaDripper#8496,sylas adc

UnaDripper#8496,he plays supp
UnaDripper#8496,bruh
flat fish#8597,sylas support would be better
UnaDripper#8496,bruh
flat fish#8597,i mean not to say sylas support isn't dumpster fire
flat fish#8597,but he has cc engage
flat fish#8597,at elast
UnaDripper#8496,so maybe he plays like
UnaDripper#8496,mf
UnaDripper#8496,and I engage with sylas
UnaDripper#8496,but then I can’t carry
UnaDripper#8496,who’s like
UnaDripper#8496,the best jungle right now
UnaDripper#8496,that suit me
flat fish#8597,kaynd
UnaDripper#8496,how hard is lee sin
UnaDripper#8496,compared to sylas
UnaDripper#8496,im also interested in viego
UnaDripper#8496,and diana
flat fish#8597,lee sin is low skill floor high skill ceiling
UnaDripper#8496,so can i pick him up and carry
UnaDripper#8496,or no
flat fish#8597,you cna probably
UnaDripper#8496,ok
flat fish#8597,but idk if you can pick up jg and carry
UnaDripper#8496,i just dont know how to jungle in general
UnaDripper#8496,yeah
UnaDripper#8496,ive played ekko and ive done pretty good

UnaDripper#8496,in the first place
UnaDripper#8496,bc those guys in the game
UnaDripper#8496,especially seraphine
UnaDripper#8496,was calling him braindead
UnaDripper#8496,my pride says otherwise
flat fish#8597,i don't think he's the easiest but his abilities are straightforward
UnaDripper#8496,she also coincidentally malding after i use her ult on her and kill her
UnaDripper#8496,pretty funny
UnaDripper#8496,and she is saying this as a seraphine player
flat fish#8597,sylas isn't braindead
UnaDripper#8496,yeah
UnaDripper#8496,but not fucking akali hard
UnaDripper#8496,and they claimed that if i tried kat i would it

UnaDripper#8496,"SURROGATE ACTIVITIES
38. But not every leisured aristocrat becomes bored and demoralized. For example, the emperor Hirohito, instead of sinking into decadent hedonism, devoted himself to marine biology, a field in which he became distinguished. When people do not have to exert themselves to satisfy their physical needs they often set up artificial goals for themselves. In many cases they then pursue these goals with the same energy and emotional involvement that they otherwise would have put into the search for physical necessities. Thus the aristocrats of the Roman Empire had their literary pretensions; many European aristocrats a few centuries ago invested tremendous time and energy in hunting, though they certainly didn’t need the meat; other aristocracies have competed for status through elaborate displays of wealth; and a few aristocrats, like Hirohito, have turned to science."
UnaDripper#8496,"39. We use the term “surrogate activity” to designate an activity that is directed toward an artificial goal that people set up for themselves merely in order to have some goal to work toward, or let us say, merely for the sake of the “fulfillment” that they get from pursuing the goal. Here is a rule of thumb for the identification of surrogate activities. Given a person who devotes much time and energy to the pursuit of goal X, ask yourself this: If he had to devote most of his time and energy to satisfying his biological needs, and if that effort required him to use his physical and mental faculties in a varied and interesting way, would he feel seriously deprived because he did not attain goal X? If the answer is no, then the person’s pursuit of goal X is a surrogate activity. Hirohito’s studies in marine biology clearly constituted a surrogate activity, since it is pretty certain that if Hirohito had had to spend his time working at interesting non-scientific tasks in order to obtain the necessities of life, he would not have felt deprived because he didn’t know all about the anatomy and life-cycles of marine animals. On the other hand the pursuit of sex and love (for example) is not a surrogate activity, because most people, even if their existence were otherwise satisfactory, would feel deprived if they passed their lives without ever having a relationship with a member of the opposite sex. (But pursuit of an excessive amount of sex, more than one really needs, can be a surrogate activity.)"

flat fish#8597,"I'm gonna sound like a child when I say this, but League genuinely made me a less happy person. It was fun at first but as I got more into it shit turned sour. People were getting more toxic and everyone around you isn't playing for fun but to win. And if you're surrounded by toxic pieces of shit you're gonna turn into a toxic piece of shit. Now when I come home from school or work I do something that makes me happy instead of something that has a small chance of making me happy. It doesn't help that the game is addicting as fuck too, I know it sounds pathetic but I tried to quit two times before. I haven't touched it in a year and a half now and I'm not looking back. I advise anyone who is thinking about downloading League not to do it. Fuck League of Legends

UnaDripper#8496,border patrol had some good character development too
flat fish#8597,the ant arc
flat fish#8597,would
flat fish#8597,w jlk
UnaDripper#8496,even kfc and watermelon was a good filler arc
flat fish#8597,was
flat fish#8597,200% longer than it needed to be
flat fish#8597,at least the second half
flat fish#8597,actually so boring
UnaDripper#8496,that’s shounen anime
flat fish#8597,no but
flat fish#8597,this
UnaDripper#8496,Pinned a message.
flat fish#8597,and they speak
flat fish#8597,at
UnaDripper#8496,you should see
flat fish#8597,the speed
flat fish#8597,of
UnaDripper#8496,one piece episode recaps
UnaDripper#8496,they are comically long
flat fish#8597,presidential speeches
flat fish#8597,but if they didn't say a word
UnaDripper#8496,at least presidential speeches are funny
flat fish#8597,and instead
UnaDripper#8496,shounen dialogue is not
flat fish#8597,the rest of the show was enjoyable though
UnaDripper#8496,ughhhh hgnnn. You killed my family and my brother and my mom and my wife and my friend!!!! I hate you you evil stupid idiot
flat fish#8597,but i go through ant arc
flat fish#8597,and i forget
flat fish#8597,but now i'm on election
flat fish#8597,and i remember the show isn't complete eeee o No eea
flat fish#8597,ai you
flat fish#8597,anyway
flat fish#8597,i should watch jjk first because i told the guy i
UnaDripper#8496,fucking tasteless fucker
UnaDripper#8496,average shaco player
UnaDripper#8496,screenshot this and send to him
UnaDripper#8496,with this text right here included
UnaDripper#8496,hey shaco bitch : )
UnaDripper#8496,also
UnaDripper#8496,I have started randomly dropping teddy’s manifesto in random servers im in
flat fish#8597,tell me what's wrong with playing shaco
UnaDripper#8496,"annoying, you need very little skill to get shit done, ganks are overpowered, very little counter play, invis plus huge blink makes it very hard to punish"
UnaDripper#8496,boxes do absurd damage whether he’s fed or not
UnaDripper#8496,if they build liandry a single box can do like 20% hp
UnaDripper#8496,or more depending on if you are a tank
flat fish#8597,is teemo overpowered
UnaDripper#8496,no
UnaDripper#8496,please don’t even try to make that comparison
UnaDripper#8496,I know where you are going
flat fish#8597,his shrooms do over half your health
UnaDripper#8496,if he’s fed
flat fish#8597,shaco does 0 damage
UnaDripper#8496,not true
flat fish#8597,if he's fed then he's a normal champion
UnaDripper#8496,sure I am playing with low level individuals but shaco can pull of easy ganks with no skill and get double or triple kills
UnaDripper#8496,extremely easy
UnaDripper#8496,press one fucking button to get in kissing distance
UnaDripper#8496,without the enemy knowing
UnaDripper#8496,and I just checked some databases
UnaDripper#8496,he has over 51% wr in all ranks
UnaDripper#8496,with a high ban rate as well
flat fish#8597,winrate isn't a the when statistic
UnaDripper#8496,it is
flat fish#8597,all his players are one tricks
flat fish#8597,is ivern op
UnaDripper#8496,no
flat fish#8597,k first i mean shaco has negative win rate in challenger
flat fish#8597,unless you meant
flat fish#8597,all ranks together
UnaDripper#8496,ok yeah
UnaDripper#8496,one out of all the ranks
flat fish#8597,the highest rank
UnaDripper#8496,obviously because it’s the highest level of play
flat fish#8597,where people use more than
UnaDripper#8496,and an extremely small minority
flat fish#8597,half their frontal cortex
flat fish#8597,people lose to shaco in low ranks because they don't have experience or refuse to learn from experience
flat fish#8597,how can shaco gank you
flat fish#8597,your laner needs to cc you
UnaDripper#8496,what
flat fish#8597,not him
flat fish#8597,i've never died from a shaco gank
UnaDripper#8496,you are turbo smart silver with 156 levels
flat fish#8597,see that's the thing i'm also silver
flat fish#8597,so i'm pretty turbo garbage actually
UnaDripper#8496,bruh
flat fish#8597,but i've never died to shaco gank
flat fish#8597,in the past
flat fish#8597,uh
flat fish#8597,school year
UnaDripper#8496,I have a feeling that’s cap but sure
UnaDripper#8496,anyhow
UnaDripper#8496,there is no counter play to his shit
UnaDripper#8496,especially early game
UnaDripper#8496,even if he doesn’t get fed
UnaDripper#8496,if he does an extremely good job of getting his team fed
UnaDripper#8496,then it’s gg
UnaDripper#8496,wards don’t matter obviously bc shaco
flat fish#8597,map impact more
flat fish#8597,as mid lane
flat fish#8597,don't ward your side brush
flat fish#8597,track his jg pathing
flat fish#8597,get deep wards
flat fish#8597,play on the opposite side
flat fish#8597,think
flat fish#8597,"""can shaco kill me now if he comes"""
flat fish#8597,if he can
flat fish#8597,don't do what you're doing
flat fish#8597,and that doesn't make him unfair
UnaDripper#8496,well it’s not really me dying to shaco
flat fish#8597,a lot of situations
flat fish#8597,he can't kill you
UnaDripper#8496,it’s usually my team
flat fish#8597,ah it's your monkey team
flat fish#8597,yeah
UnaDripper#8496,yeah basically
flat fish#8597,i get that too
UnaDripper#8496,that’s why I permaban
UnaDripper#8496,bc team don’t know how to play
UnaDripper#8496,and then shaco farms them all
flat fish#8597,i'm silver not because i perform badly
flat fish#8597,but because i can't help my team enough
flat fish#8597,that's a nice way of saying my team is monkey offal
flat fish#8597,uh
UnaDripper#8496,bruh
flat fish#8597,yeah they are really bad
flat fish#8597,but the mindset is
flat fish#8597,i need to be
flat fish#8597,extra good
flat fish#8597,so that i can carry them
UnaDripper#8496,yeah basically
flat fish#8597,which is really frustrating
flat fish#8597,because
UnaDripper#8496,but even if I for example get fed as sylas or whatever
flat fish#8597,if i'm just afk in lane my bot lane should still win 50% time yeah?
flat fish#8597,does not
UnaDripper#8496,yeah
UnaDripper#8496,and especially since sylas is pretty situational
UnaDripper#8496,with his kit steal
UnaDripper#8496,it’s hard to carry with shit ults or counters to me
UnaDripper#8496,and with kayn
UnaDripper#8496,unless I’m 20/0 it’s fucking impossible
UnaDripper#8496,especially since I don’t like red that much
flat fish#8597,i'm pretty sure you can do more
flat fish#8597,and i can do more
flat fish#8597,it's frustrating because i have to play like a gold 4 player to get out of silver 4
UnaDripper#8496,bruh
flat fish#8597,i don't play video games enough to climb at a normal speed either i think
UnaDripper#8496,mm
flat fish#8597,but whatever i just sound like i'm whining now

flat fish#8597,i'm confused
UnaDripper#8496,the left
UnaDripper#8496,is a weeb
flat fish#8597,
UnaDripper#8496,exactly
flat fish#8597,w
UnaDripper#8496,the point of the thing
flat fish#8597,i am not familiar with the joke
UnaDripper#8496,is to show how many weebs have contradicting points during arguments
UnaDripper#8496,in the first part
flat fish#8597,mm
flat fish#8597,se
UnaDripper#8496,he says that the fictional character is real to him
flat fish#8597,i see
UnaDripper#8496,then in the second
UnaDripper#8496,when a normal person criticizes him for liking an underage character
UnaDripper#8496,he says that it’s a fictional character

UnaDripper#8496,That isn’t how you clean a car. Chances are she exposed her breast to the driver because she thought he was “so hot” and also because he likely had some contraband in his vehicle (such as marijuana or a firearm). She exposed her breast to him to make him hard so she could suck his cock and bathe in his cum. She probably lactated a little bit on the window. Fucking disgusting. She shouldn’t be employed at a car wash to begin with if she’s gonna do this stupid fucking shit. Is this supposed to give me an erection? Sheer work-place incompetence? This is just pathetic. Is western civilization really at a point where we think being sexually perverse and lazy on the job site is something that is arousing? Good Lord...

UnaDripper#8496,it’s wonderful
UnaDripper#8496,"Theory: Yuumi is a Darkin, and its true name is Yaami (which is the Japanese word for ""darkness”.
We see several parallels between Yuumi and Darkins:
* Darkins usually have 2 ""a""s in their name, such as Aatrox or Rhaast. Yaami, in an attempt to hide its true nature, replaced the a's in its name with u's to become Yuumi, and also adopted she/her pronouns
* Yaami is the Japanese word for ""darkness"", which would make complete sense if Yuumi/Yaami is a Darkin
* Darkins are corrupted Ascendeds. As we know, Ascendeds adopt animal forms, such as Nasus (dog), Renekton (crocodile), and Azir (bird). Yaami was once a cat-themed Ascendant.
* Darkins take on the form of sentient weapons. Yuumi is sentient. Yuumi also counts as a weapon, since she's practically an item once she attaches to you.
* Who is Yuumi's wielder, then? It has to be Norra, the upcoming mage, who is fleeing Yuumi's influence by traveling to the Shadow Isle. Norra's anti-mobility magic wasn't meant to counter assassins. It was meant to stop Yuumi from reaching her.
Thank you."

flat fish#8597,this show is very excellent
flat fish#8597,and
flat fish#8597,i defeinitely see where rem
flat fish#8597,yep
UnaDripper#8496,good
UnaDripper#8496,also I don’t want to be a party pooper
UnaDripper#8496,but in my opinion
UnaDripper#8496,season 2 is not bad
UnaDripper#8496,but far worse compared to s1
UnaDripper#8496,s1 was a 9.5/10
UnaDripper#8496,s2 is like 7.5
flat fish#8597,about rem and emilia
UnaDripper#8496,yes
flat fish#8597,yes
flat fish#8597,ok
flat fish#8597,i think emilia's still better
flat fish#8597,rem just gets
flat fish#8597,a lot more attention
flat fish#8597,and screentime
UnaDripper#8496,I can respect that
flat fish#8597,i like watching emilia interact more than rem
flat fish#8597,but subaru's so dumpster fire
flat fish#8597,it's not clear wh
flat fish#8597,idk
UnaDripper#8496,yeah the writing on subarus dialogue is very sloppy sometimes
flat fish#8597,no i mean
flat fish#8597,he's just
flat fish#8597,dumpster fire
flat fish#8597,as a person
UnaDripper#8496,yeah true
UnaDripper#8496,that too
UnaDripper#8496,first he was like refreshing to hear bc he’s like not your average shounen protag
UnaDripper#8496,but then it got old
UnaDripper#8496,pretty quickly
UnaDripper#8496,and that’s one of my biggest complaints about the show
UnaDripper#8496,and it gets really bad in s2
flat fish#8597,m
flat fish#8597,here's what i was ging to say too
flat fish#8597,i really liked how fast the show was
UnaDripper#8496,yeah
flat fish#8597,there was so much
flat fish#8597,in the first episodes
flat fish#8597,i think recently it slowed down
flat fish#8597,but
flat fish#8597,also
flat fish#8597,i just finished th episode
UnaDripper#8496,I mean I think the pacing overall in s1 is great
flat fish#8597,where subaru and rem talk on the roof and
flat fish#8597,he decides to start from 0
flat fish#8597,and the next episode
flat fish#8597,starts with him tlaking to crusch
flat fish#8597,negotiating
flat fish#8597,and actually using what he's learned
UnaDripper#8496,five head
flat fish#8597,i think it'll be exciting again
UnaDripper#8496,s1 pacing is good
UnaDripper#8496,s2 is ay yoooo
flat fish#8597,actually revived the pace of the show from zero
flat fish#8597,i thought it was so fast and then i realized nothing was progressing but i think that was the point
UnaDripper#8496,yeah
UnaDripper#8496,if they pacing was slow
flat fish#8597,so i'm excited  to see what's goign to happen now he decides to
flat fish#8597,actuall do things
flat fish#8597,and not
flat fish#8597,stupid
UnaDripper#8496,yeah
flat fish#8597,i'm so immersed
flat fish#8597,i stopped watching and had to brush my teeth
flat fish#8597,and i remembered how i had to actually do things in life
UnaDripper#8496,bruh

flat fish#8597,i think they were mexican so i think i might be racist
flat fish#8597,ayway
flat fish#8597,i run home
flat fish#8597,there are traffic cones around the entire block and they source from my house
flat fish#8597,there are like 20 workers at the hosue
UnaDripper#8496,based
flat fish#8597,(the 20 workers were all mexican too i think)
flat fish#8597,not even police or fire department
flat fish#8597,just like
flat fish#8597,construction workers?
flat fish#8597,but even more general than that
UnaDripper#8496,cartel members
flat fish#8597,yeah so my mom explained what happend
flat fish#8597,i go back to jls
flat fish#8597,what happened there was kind of boring
flat fish#8597,i just got food and stuff
flat fish#8597,dude there was so much detail in this dream
flat fish#8597,like
flat fish#8597,i remember i spent a great amount of time
flat fish#8597,opening my locker's lock
flat fish#8597,at least a minute
flat fish#8597,ok so the really help detail
flat fish#8597,and why i told you all of this
flat fish#8597,the first time i was walking to jls
flat fish#8597,i saw
flat fish#8597,two
flat fish#8597,objects on the ground
flat fish#8597,on the way
flat fish#8597,that looked like among us
flat fish#8597,i stopped to take pictures of both
flat fish#8597,the lore is more deep than that
flat fish#8597,the family that attacked my house
flat fish#8597,also attacked my friend's house
flat fish#8597,and i found out there was something at his house before i even found out my house was being attacked
flat fish#8597,because he said something was going on at his hosue when i asked something i forgot
flat fish#8597,so somehow
flat fish#8597,my brain created a situation where i got hints of bad things happening before i even knew what the thing was
flat fish#8597,and i know things using my brain
flat fish#8597,how does that happen

UnaDripper#8496,my favorite?
UnaDripper#8496,hmm
UnaDripper#8496,personality wise the fucking femboy is the best

UnaDripper#8496,am I gay
flat fish#8597,no yuo're not gay for being attracted to rukako
UnaDripper#8496,ok
UnaDripper#8496,good
UnaDripper#8496,but damn he’s hot
flat fish#8597,mm
UnaDripper#8496,I think femboys have been so fetishized on the internet
UnaDripper#8496,"to the point where I, a straight male am lowkey attracted to them"
flat fish#8597,the past three anime i've watched have all had a cat figure who speaks with the nya nya na aa anaayya a aadniweo aek  el ewbrain
UnaDripper#8496,I would rather be pegged than be in the general vicinity of those
UnaDripper#8496,aside from felix
UnaDripper#8496,he’s cool
flat fish#8597,
UnaDripper#8496,yeah
UnaDripper#8496,that’s right
UnaDripper#8496,clip it
flat fish#8597,in my opiinion it's not gay to like a femboy until the sex
flat fish#8597,because aside form that
flat fish#8597,literally female
flat fish#8597,is steins;gate done?
flat fish#8597,the anime

UnaDripper#8496,October last year
UnaDripper#8496,but no news on that
UnaDripper#8496,since then
flat fish#8597,ok i'm guessing  suzuha was the one that stabbed makise though right

flat fish#8597,so everything should be the same
flat fish#8597,so he can try again
flat fish#8597,alrigh no fuel
flat fish#8597,there's a lot of stuff in this show similar to re zero i think
flat fish#8597,i like  this one more because the main character is competent
flat fish#8597,but how cool was his message to his past self
flat fish#8597,how cool
UnaDripper#8496,yeah like
UnaDripper#8496,it’s pretty fucking well written
UnaDripper#8496,to say the least
UnaDripper#8496,this was never predictable
UnaDripper#8496,shit was
flat fish#8597,i kind of saw
flat fish#8597,changing the past without changing it
UnaDripper#8496,but like in general
UnaDripper#8496,most of the twists were pretty
flat fish#8597,but that's because i jst think about that stuff in daydreams for no reason
UnaDripper#8496,bruh
UnaDripper#8496,and the conflicts are interesting
UnaDripper#8496,like there are real stakes
flat fish#8597,only things are like
UnaDripper#8496,no shounen power ups
flat fish#8597,how tf did the gender change
UnaDripper#8496,idk
flat fish#8597,how did he manage to get to the phone microwave those times moeka killed mua
flat fish#8597,i like how steins;gate actuall ended up meaning nothing
UnaDripper#8496,bro what
UnaDripper#8496,excuse me
flat fish#8597,i mean
flat fish#8597,it's the name of the target line
flat fish#8597,but it comes from nothing
UnaDripper#8496,oh well
UnaDripper#8496,yeah I mean
UnaDripper#8496,it’s like reaching the gates over heaven or something
UnaDripper#8496,*of
UnaDripper#8496,but that’s why it’s good too
UnaDripper#8496,wait
UnaDripper#8496,oh shit

UnaDripper#8496,I don’t even remember that part
UnaDripper#8496,just finish
UnaDripper#8496,then we
UnaDripper#8496,discuss
flat fish#8597,oh
flat fish#8597,the metal prevented the folder from burning ro seomthing
flat fish#8597,how hard is it to experience time travel g force with a stomach wound
flat fish#8597,damn

UnaDripper#8496,pogger
flat fish#8597,bruh
UnaDripper#8496,duality of retards
UnaDripper#8496,sorry I’m talking to woman
UnaDripper#8496,right now
flat fish#8597,19 episodes of anime
flat fish#8597,one day
flat fish#8597,"""From there he calls Kurisu ""Christina"" again, which manages to reawaken her memories of the other world lines."" ohhh"
UnaDripper#8496,mm
flat fish#8597,was
flat fish#8597,not clear but
flat fish#8597,that is much more satisfying
flat fish#8597,ok then that ending was basically perfect i think
flat fish#8597,if you just read that on the wiki
flat fish#8597,"From there he calls Kurisu ""Christina"" again, which manages to reawaken her memories of the other world lines."
UnaDripper#8496,yeah
UnaDripper#8496,overall
UnaDripper#8496,definitely a masterpiece
UnaDripper#8496,in my opinion
UnaDripper#8496,top 3 anime
UnaDripper#8496,"fma, aot, steins gate"
flat fish#8597,i think mine are steins;gate fmab and re zero
flat fish#8597,but i tend to just like whatever i'm watching
UnaDripper#8496,true
flat fish#8597,but that's nt always true
flat fish#8597,i never thought hxh was my favorite
flat fish#8597,and
flat fish#8597,sorry to say
flat fish#8597,aot
UnaDripper#8496,mm
UnaDripper#8496,EAT
flat fish#8597,definitely applied to bunny girl senpai though if i'm being honest
flat fish#8597,i still reall like it i think
UnaDripper#8496,
UnaDripper#8496,bruh
UnaDripper#8496,an actual comical comment
UnaDripper#8496,on a jojo video
UnaDripper#8496,how
flat fish#8597,
UnaDripper#8496,Eat
UnaDripper#8496,EAT
flat fish#8597,<-
flat fish#8597,what the hell
flat fish#8597,whatever
flat fish#8597,that's for tomorrow
UnaDripper#8496,yep
flat fish#8597,but yeah definitely this one sentence was extremely satisfying
flat fish#8597,"From there he calls Kurisu ""Christina"" again, which manages to reawaken her memories of the other world lines."
flat fish#8597,that made the ending so much better
flat fish#8597,actually feels complete
flat fish#8597,mm yeah about the
UnaDripper#8496,about the what
flat fish#8597,idk
flat fish#8597,you were going to say something
flat fish#8597,about steins;gate
flat fish#8597,the origin of the words
UnaDripper#8496,oh yeah
UnaDripper#8496,I mean like
UnaDripper#8496,pretty sure it’s described in the anime
UnaDripper#8496,as like
UnaDripper#8496,the ultimate timeline
UnaDripper#8496,in which everything worths out
UnaDripper#8496,but that’s kinda unrealistic
UnaDripper#8496,which also keeps the anime more grounded
UnaDripper#8496,and enjoyable
UnaDripper#8496,bc it isn’t the very happy ending
UnaDripper#8496,it’s kind of in between
flat fish#8597,i'm
flat fish#8597,goign to bed
UnaDripper#8496,yeah same
flat fish#8597,good
